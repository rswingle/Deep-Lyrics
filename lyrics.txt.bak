Money, who needs it
Let me live a life free and easy
Put a toothbrush in my hand
Let me be a travelling man
I'm a roadrunner, baby
Roadrunner
Roadrunner
I'm a road runner baby, 
Can't stay in one place too long 
I'm a road runner, 
You might look at me 
And I'll be gone 
Well you can love me if you wanna 
But I do declare 
When I get restless 
I got to move somewhere 
Yes, I'm a road runner baby, 
Anywhere is my home 
And I love the life I live 
And I'm gonna live the life I love 
Roadrunner baby 
Roadrunner Roadrunner 
Don't want no woman to tie me down 
Gotta be free baby to roam around 
All my life I've been like this 
You can love me at your own risk 
When the dust hits my shoes 
I got the urge to move 
'Cause I'm a road runner baby, 
Gotta keep on, keepin' on
And I live the life I love 
And I'm gonna love the life I live 
Roadrunner baby
Roadrunner Roadrunner


Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together

So you think '21
Is going to be a good year
It could be good for me and her
But you and her, no never!
I had no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather

What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!

You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You won't say nothing to no-one
Never in your life
You never heard it
Oh, how absurd it all seems
Without any proof
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You never heard it, not a word of it
You won't say nothing to no-one
Never tell a soul
What you know is the Truth

Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together

Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together

I had no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather


NORA:
Got a feeling fifty one
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it out together

FRANK:
So you think that fifty one
Is going to be a good year
We'll marry now and
See it out together

NORA:
I have no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow when you smile
I can brave bad weather

What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy
He saw it all

FRANK:
He didn't hear it
He didn't see it
He won't say nothin' to no one ever in your life
You never heard it
How absurd it
All seems without any proof

NORA:
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You won't say nothin' to no one ever in your life
You never heard it
How absurd it
All seems without any proof

NORA and FRANK:
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You never heard it not a word of it
You won't say nothin' to no one
Never tell a soul
What you know is the Truth

Mother was an incubator
Father was the contents
Of a test tube in the ice box
In the factory of birth

My name is 905,
And I've just become alive
I'm the newest populator
Of the planet we call Earth

In suspended animation
My childhood passed me by
If I speak without emotion
Then you know the reason why

Knowledge of the universe
Was fed into my mind
As my adolescent body
Left its puberty behind

And everything I know is what I need to know
And everything I do's been done before
Every sentence in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door

Automatically defrosted
When manhood came on time
I became a man
I left the "ice school" behind

Now I'm to begin
The life that I'm assigned
A life that's been used before
A thousand times

I have a feeling deep inside
That somethin' is missing
It's a feeling in my soul
And I can't help wishing

That one day I'll discover
That we're living a lie
And I'll tell the whole world
The reason why

Well, until then, everything I know is what I need to know
And everything I do's been done before
Every sentence in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door


I told you why I changed my mind
I got bored by playing with time
I know you thought you had me nailed
But I've freed my head from your garden rails

Now it's a legal matter, baby
You got me on the run
It's a legal matter, baby
A legal matter from now on

My mind's lost in a household fog
Wedding gowns and catalogs
Kitchen furnishings and houses
Maternity clothes and baby's trousers

It's a legal matter, baby
Marryin's no fun
It's a legal matter, baby
A legal matter from now on

I told you why I changed my mind
I got bored by playing with time
I know you thought you had me nailed
Well, I've freed my head from your garden rails

Now it's a legal matter, baby
You got me on the run
It's a legal matter, baby
A legal matter from now on

You ain't the first and you ain't the last
I gain and lose my women fast
I never want to make them cry
I just get bored, don't ask me why

Just wanna keep doing all the dirty little things I do
And not work all day in an office just to bring my money back to you
Sorry, baby


They say that love often passes in a second
And you never can catch it up
So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned
But it's clear that the match is rough
Common sense 'd tell me not to try 'n continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you

So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body so edible
You give me an overdose of love
Just a little is a enough

I'm connoisseur of champagne cognac
The perfume nearly beats the taste
I eat an oyster, and I feel the contact
But more than one would be a waste
Some people want an endless line, that's true
But all I have's a little time with you

A smile sets me reeling
A kiss feels like stealing
Your love is like heroin
This addict is mellowing
I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough

Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place
Life would seem so easy on the other tack
But even a hurricane won't turn me back

You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me
I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough

Common sense 'd tell me not to try and continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body so edible
You give me an overdose of love
A little is enough


How dare you wear robes and reside
How dare you cover your head to hide
Your face from God

How dare you smile from behind your beard
To hide the fact that your hearts are feared
And wave your rod

How dare you be the one to assess
Me in this godforsaken mess
You, a man in a purple dress
A man in a purple dress

When you place your frown
Between my God and prayer
However grand your crown
Or dignified your hair
Men above men all prats
In your high hats

You priest, you mullah so high
You pope, you wise rabbi
You're invisible to me
Like vapor from the sea

I lovingly mock you noble lords
We all dress up to grand awards
I do that as well

I dare condemn your fashion sense
At least you're not astride the fence
That wouldn't sell

But I will deliver this address
Your souls conditioned don't impress
You, a man in a purple dress
A man in a purple dress


You talk about crazy affairs
You talk about crazy affairs
You talk about your life as though it mattered
You talk about your life as though it mattered
You get attention 'cause you block the stairs
You get attention 'cause you block the stairs
Bragging about some bottles you have shattered
Bragging about some bottles you have shattered

Well, I met a man who really lives
Well, I met a man who really lives
He really does it all
He really does it all
But what really matters is the heart he gives
But what really matters is the heart he gives
He makes your talk seem small
He makes your talk seem small

When a man is a man
When a man is a man
He doesn't act to a plan
He doesn't act to a plan
He don't have to perform like John Wayne in some B feature flick
He don't have to perform like john wayne in some B feature flick
A man is a man
A man is a man
When he can offer his hand
When he can offer his hand
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
I know a man who's a man
I know a man who's a man

Can't you sometimes crack a smile?
Can't you sometimes crack a smile?
Do you think if you did, we would run and tell?
Do you think if you did, we would run and tell?
I know one day your big villain style
I know one day your big villain style
Will collapse as they turn the key in the door of your cell
Will collapse as they turn the key in the door of your cell

I know a man who was once like you
I know a man who was once like you
But he opened his heart
But he opened his heart
No one is really bad right through
No one is really bad right through
He's just another part
He's just another part

When a man is a man
When a man is a man
And he drinks till he's canned
And he drinks till he's canned
He can drop to the floor, he can weep; we won't ask the price
He can drop to the floor, he can weep; we won't ask the price
A man is a man
A man is a man
He can fall, he can stand
He can fall, he can stand
We won't love him more if he keeps his soul on the ice
We won't love him more if he keeps his soul on the ice
I know a man who's a man
I know a man who's a man

Every one of us is looking for fame
Every one of us is looking for fame
He's a looker
He's a looker
He's a dresser
He's a dresser
He's a genius under pressure
He's a genius under pressure
I know a man who could tighten your rein
I know a man who could tighten your rein
He's a father
He's a father
He's a brother
He's a brother
He's a rock
He's a rock
He's a lover
He's a lover

He's a man, he's a man
He's a man, he's a man
He doesn't act to a plan
He doesn't act to a plan
He don't have to get hitched to a train in some muscle beach trick
He don't have to get hitched to a train in some muscle beach trick
A man is a man
A man is a man
When he can offer his hand
When he can offer his hand
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
Be a man who's a man
Be a man who's a man


Her man's been gone
For nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here

Her man's been gone
For nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here

Down your street your crying is a well-known sound
Your street is very well known throughout town
Your town is very famous for the little girl
Whose crying can be heard all around the world

We have a remedy
You'll appreciate
No need to feel so bad
He's only late

We'll bring you flowers and things
Help pass your time
We'll give him eagle's wings
Then he can fly to you

Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la la

We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la

Little girl guide, why don't you stop your crying?
Here comes Ivor the Engine Driver to make you feel much better

(Dirty old sod)
(I say, steady on)

My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver

I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just 'cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through

He told me he loves you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
Let's have a smile for an old engine driver

Here he comes

Soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

Come on, old horse

We'll soon be home
Soon be home

Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang

Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello

I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again

I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap

ABBIE HOFFMAN:
I think this is a pile of shit! While John Sinclair rots in prison!

PETE TOWNSHEND:
Fuck off! Eh! Fuck off my fucking stage!


After the fire the fire still burns,
The heart grows older but never ever learns.
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns,
After the fire the fire still burns.

I heard a voice asking what happens after the fire
And then the sound of a breaking window and the scream of a tire
And then the sound of Brixton gun and the scream of a child.
The night is hot
But nothing's going to stop
This gang running wild.

After the fire the fire still burns,
The heart grows older but never ever learns.
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns,
After the fire the fire still burns.

I saw Matt Dillon in black and white
There ain't no color in memories.
He rode his brother's Harley across the TV
While I was laughing at Dom DeLuise.
Now I'm cycling all my video tapes, I'm crying and I'm joking.
I've gotta stop drinking, I've gotta stop thinking,
I've gotta stop smoking.

After the fire the fire still burns,
The heart grows older but never ever learns.
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns,
After the fire
The fire still burns, raging through the pain,
Blackening the promises, the tears and the rain.
The fire will burn
'til the wind begins to turn
And it all begins again.
After the fireeeee ...Yea the fire still burns

After the fire the fire still burns,
The heart grows older but never ever learns.
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns,
After the fire the fire still burns,
The fire still burns,
After the fire the fire still burns,
The heart grows older but never ever learns.
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns,
After the fire the fire still burns.


Yours is yours
What's mine is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine

I don't care
I know you're gonna hate this song
And that's fair
We never really got along
It's not new, not diverse
It won't light up your parade
It's just simple verse

All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade

I'm long gone
And I ain't never coming back
What's wrong?
I've never really quite gone bland
I'm not blue, I'm not pink
I'm just grey, I'm afraid
And it seems in a blink

All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)
All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)

What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine

I don't mind
Other guys ripping off my song
I'd be a liar
If I said I never done no wrong
Oh, this sound that we share
Has already been played
And it hangs in the air

All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)
All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade

I don't care
I know you're gonna hate this song
That's fair
'Cause we never really got along
It's not new, not diverse
It won't light up your parade
It's just simple verse

All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade

What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's yours is yours

Yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
And what's mine is mine, and what's mine is yours
Who gives a fuck?


Deaf, dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems, his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad

Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know

A vague haze of delirium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver sparkled
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground

Nothing to say, nothing to hear
Nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know

His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
He is your leader
He is your guide
On the amazing journey
Together you'll ride


You can't always get it
When you really want it
You can't always get it at all
Just because there's space
In your life it's a waste
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call

(Just gotta get used to it)
We all get it in the end
(Just gotta get used to it)
We go down and we come up again
(Just gotta get used to it)
You irritate me my friend
(This is no social crisis)
This is you having fun
(No crisis)
Getting burned by the sun
(This is true)
This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you

You can always get higher
Just because you aspire
You could expire even knowing.
Don't push the hands
Just hang on to the band
You can dance while your knowledge is growing

(It could happen anytime)
You can't expect to never cry
(Patience is priceless)
Not when you try to fly so high
(Just stay on that line)
Rock and roll will never die
(This is no social crisis)

Another tricky day
Another gently nagging pain
What the papers say
Just seems to bring down heavier rain
The world seems in a spiral
Life seems such a worthless title
But break out and start a fire y'all
It's all here on the vinyl
(No crisis)

You can't always get it
When you really want it
You can't always get it at all
Just because there's space
In your life it's a waste
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call

(Just gotta get used to it)
Gotta get used to waiting
(Just gotta get used to it)
You know how the ice is
(Just gotta get used to it)
It's thin where you're skating
(This is no social crisis)

Just another tricky day for you fella


Anytime anytime anytime anytime you want me,
Come on back, come on home.
Ran away and left me alone in this empty place,
Anywhere I go, whoa whoa, all I see is your sweet face,
Though my pain keeps on growing,
There's one thing, baby, you should be knowing...
Anytime you want me (come on back),
Anytime you want me (come on back),
Anytime you want me (come on back, whoa yeah).
Tried to make you happy the very best I could,
Anything you wanted, whoa whoa, just like a good man should,
Even though you did me wrong,
I'll be waiting no matter how long...
Anytime you want me (I'll be here),
Anytime you want me (I promise I'll be here, baby),
Anytime you want me (I'll be by your side, whoa yeah).
Said I'll forgive you for everything in the past,
All I need is one more chance, I know, I know it will last.
Now you heard my story, know just what's on my mind,
Tired of being lonely, whoa whoa, I've had my share of crying,
Without you I can't go on,
I'll be waiting no matter how long...
Anytime you want me (anytime you want me),
Anytime you want me (anytime you need me),
Anytime you want me (anytime you want me now),
Oh oh oh, anytime you want me.


I can go anyway, way I choose
I can live anyhow, win or lose
I can go anywhere, for something new
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

I can do anything, right or wrong
I can talk anyhow, and get along
Don't care anyway, I never lose
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines
That been laid before
I get along anyway I dare
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere

I can go anyway, way I choose
I can live anyhow, win or lose
I can do anything, for something new
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

(Oooh) anyway
(Oooh) Anyway I choose, yeah
(Oooh) Anyway I want to go
(Oooh) I want to go 'n do it myself
Do it myself
Do it myself, yeah
Anyway, way I choose
Anyway I choose
Yeah, yeah
Ain't never gonna lose the way I choose
The way I choose
The way I choose


If you're troubled and you can't relax
Close your eyes and think on this
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts
Close your eyes and think on this

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

If you ever want to lose some time
Just take off, there's no risk
If you ever want to disappear
Just take off and think of this

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

The sky is glass but the sea is brown
And everyone is upside down

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

Freak out!
Freak out!


I had no idea how much I need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating
When I think my guess was wrong
But I think I'll get alone
She's just a girl
She's a bomb

Athena
All I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled
And she's the reason
Just one word from her
And my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll get along
She's just a girl
She's a bomb
She's a bomb
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Athena
My heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants
You find on a crazy path
I'd have stopped myself to give her time
She didn't need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath
She's just a girl
She's a bomb
She's just a girl
She's a bomb
Consumed
There was a beautiful white horse
I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe
Livin' in his rib cage

I felt like a pickled priest
Who was being flambed
You've got me requisitioned blondie
She's just a girl
She's a bomb
I'm happy
She's a bomb
I'm ecstatic
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl

Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the mem'ry claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain

Athena
You picked me up by my lapels
And screamed "leave her"
I felt like waking up in heaven
On an empty meter
And now you're stuck
With a castrated leader
And I hate the creep
I didn't mean that
She's a bomb
I just said it
She's a bomb
Please She's a bomb

Athena
I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled
And she's the reason
Just one word from her
And my troubles are long gone
Ooh but I get along
She's just a girl
She's a bomb
She's just a girl
She's a bomb


Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand
We'll travel south 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older

Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland, oh, yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted


Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart
'Cause I sacrifice to make you happy
Get nothin' for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I believe, baby, you'd better keep on keepin' on
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, oh don't do it baby
Don't break my heart

My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much
And lettin' you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causin' me
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best
Don't you do it, don't break my heart

Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?
I'm no good without you, can't go on without you
Life's no good without you, what'm I gonna do without you?
Baby don't do it, don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby, don't you break my heart
What'm I gonna do without you?
Got to go on, baby
Baby don't you do it


Loon at the bag o'nails

Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain
Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain

That pretty piece off Cuba
Designed to cause men pain
Whoa, when you light up in Cuba
You won't feel the same again

Down in Guantanamo
Whew, still waiting for the big cigars
Down in Guantanamo
Whew, still waiting for the big cigars

Been a breach of promise
Still guilty with no charge
There's smoke in the forest
And the tumor is getting large

Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain
Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain

There's a long road to travel
For justice to make its claim
So let's bring down the gavel
Let the prisoner say his name

Mmm, still waiting for the big cigars
Still waiting for the
Still waiting for the big cigars

Hey, still waiting for the big cigars

I'd gladly lose me to find you
I'd gladly give up all I had
To find you I'd suffer anything and be glad

I'd pay any price just to get you
I'd work all my life and I will
To win you I'd stand naked, stoned and stabbed

I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had

I'd gladly lose me to find you
I'd gladly give up all I got
To catch you I'm gonna run and never stop

I'd pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you I'm gonna drown an unsung man

I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had

I sit looking 'round
I look at my face in the mirror
I know I'm worth nothing without you
In life one and one don't make two
One and one make one
And I'm looking for that free ride to me
I'm looking for you

I'd gladly lose me to find you
I'd gladly give up all I got
To catch you I'm gonna run and never stop

I'd pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you I'm gonna drown an unsung man

I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had

Don't you ever say never
It don't mean a thing
Going to get us together
Like beads on'one'string
There's always someone'to blame
You don't have to look'far
Now the world is a fleeting dot in the stars
I don't care how you name Him
He is always the same
I just know that we shame Him
When we kill in His name

This can't go on forever
This war in a ring
Gotta bring us together
Like beads on one string

Don't you ever say never (Don't you ever say never)
'Cause it don't mean a thing (It don't mean a thing)
Gonna get us together (Gonna get us together)
Like beads on one string (Like beads on one string)
Every one of us perfect (Like beads on one string)
But we all have a flaw (Like beads on one string)
Then we look for the defects and we go off to war (Like beads on one string)
And we send all our children (Like beads on one string)
Again and again (Like beads on one string)
It's our fear that we're building (Like beads on one string)
And we're really the same

This can't go on forever
This war in a ring
Gotta bring us together
Like beads on one string

Don't you ever say never (Don't you ever say never)
'Cause it don't mean a thing (It don't mean a thing)
Gonna get us together (Gonna get us together)
Like beads on one string (Like beads on one string)
Don't you ever say never (Like beads on one string)
'Cause it don't mean a thing (Like beads on one string)
(Like beads on one string)
Don't you ever say never

(Like beads on one string)
(Like beads on one string)
(Like beads on one string)
(Like beads on one string)
Don't you ever say never
(Like beads on one string) To never
(Like beads on one string) Got to know me a ring
(Like beads on one string) Gotta get us together
Like beads on one string

(Like beads on one string)
(Like beads on one string)
Like beads on a string
(Like beads on one string)

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams
They aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be

I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams
They aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be

I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes


The beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
Well I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Crazy days, crazy days

Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in sixty-three

I've got a good job, and I'm newly born
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
I work in hotel, all gilt and flash
Remember the place where the doors were smashed?

Bell Boy, I got to get running now
Bell Boy, keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy, carry this baggage out
Bell Boy, always running at someone's pleading heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel

Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks

A beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real

Well I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days (crazy days, crazy days, crazy days, crazy days)

Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in sixty-three

People often change
But when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot from
A job like mine
The secret to me
It ain't flown on a flag
I carry it behind
This pretty little badge
What says

Bell Boy I got to get running now
Bell Boy, keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy, carry the bloody baggage out
Bell Boy, always running at someone's heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel


FRANK:
I'm your friendly green coat
And I welcome you to Bernie's Holiday Camp
One day and you'll be happy
It's Bernie you will thank
You must be little Tommy
Well call me Uncle Frank

Welcome you too, Mrs. Walker
Here you'll always find a helping hand
The camp with the extras
(I'm in chalet number eleven)
When you come to Bernie's
You might think you're in heaven

TOMMY: 
Didn't know I had an Uncle Frank
I've never met him, have I?
Look there, Mum, a cage of budgies
Swimming pool and donkey rides, all free!
It's all free, Mum!

FRANK:
Here we have the winner, folks
Have you ever seen a lovelier pair?
What a shapely ankle
What a perfect shin
If you could feel this silken thigh
You'd know who has to win
If you could feel this silken thigh
You'd know...

NORA:
You don't know how much I've missed
To feel a man again to dance, to kiss

FRANK:
Your eyes reveal you're lonely

NORA:
This evening must pass slowly
Until we're one my heart won't rest
Will Tommy share our happiness?
You don't know how much I've missed
To feel a man again to dance, to kiss

FRANK:
Of course he will I'll make him smile
I'll take him out to cinemas and fairs
Football and cricket
There'll never be a happier lad
I'll be more than an Uncle
I'll be just like a Dad

TOMMY:
I will be a green coat, too
And when I'm big, I'll own a holiday camp
A camp with a difference
Always be good weather
When you come to Tommy's
The holiday's forever

NORA:
I'm glad you like your Uncle Frank
He'll surely love you, too
Just like a Dad

TOMMY:
He's very nice, I think
Did he fight in the war?

TOMMY and NORA:
When he's got his greencoat on
I love him even more


You jumped out of an alley
With surprise in your black widow's eyes
I was prepared to be unprepared
Been preparing for lights

I fell right in love with you
Into a thousand parts I blew
I fell right in love with you

I was caught in a corner
He recoiled from a broken romance
Taking breath after once undead
I had a firm grip on my pants

I fell right in love with you
Through a hundred hearts you flew
I fell right in love with you

Strange that when infatuation calls
We think that we've got real love in our life
It pumps like the pressure in a station hall
As the express train thunders on by

I fell right in love with you
As the blood came blowing through
I fell right in love with you

Across the room
I saw your eyes
Black window looking back at me
You held a gun
As children cried
You touched some wires
They shattered me

I was blown into a blue
There'd been nothing I could do
I fell right in love with you

I rose up to the station
Smelt your scent by the door
You stood waiting so patient
Just one wait, then no more

I fell right in love with you
There'd been nothing I could do
I fell right in love with you

Across the room
I saw your eyes
Black window looking back at me
You held a gun
As children cried
You touched some wires
They shattered me


(lyrics vary from show to show, this one's from 1979/09/13 New York)

Blue, blue, blue, you brought me through
Black, black, black, you took me back
And I mean it
Red, red, red, I'd like to know what's in your head
I could love you if you let me
I could love you if you let me
Red, red, red, I wanna know what's in your head
White, white, white, we think we're all so right
White, white, white, I think the kids are alright
Everyone's a fool in their own way
Everyone's a fool in their own way


Some people seem so obsessed with the morning
Get up early just to see the sun rise
Some people like it more when there's fire in the sky
Worship the sun when it's high
Some people go for those sultry evenings
Sipping cocktails in the blue, red and grey

But I like every minute of the day

I like every second, so long as you are on my mind
Every moment has its special charm 
It's alright when you're around, rain or shine

I know a crowd who only live after midnight
Their faces always seem so pale
And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight
They say a suntan never fails
I know a man who works the night shift
He's lucky to get a job and some pay

And I like every minute of the day

I dig every second
I can laugh in the snow and rain
I get a buzz from being cold and wet
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain

And so you see that I'm completely crazy 
I even shun the south of France
The people on the hill, they say I'm lazy
But when they sleep, I sing and dance
Some people have to have the sutlry evenings
Cocktails in the blue, red and grey

But I like every minute of the day

I like every minute of the day


I got a girl named Bony Maronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
I see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on
Not very fat, just skin and bones

I love her, and she loves me
Boy, how happy we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree

My one and only, she's my hearts desire
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
Gonna get married on a night in June
Rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon

I love her, and she loves me
Boy, how happy we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree

Told her mama and her papa too
Just exactly what we're gonna do
We're gonna get married in a night in June
To rock and roll in the light of the silvery moon

I love her, and she loves me
Boy, how happy we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree


Look, he's crawling up my wall 
Black and hairy, very small 
Now he's up above my head 
Hanging by a little thread 

Boris the spider 
Boris the spider 

Now he's dropped on to the floor 
Heading for the bedroom door 
Maybe he's as scared as me 
Where's he gone now, I can't see 

Boris the spider 
Boris the spider 

Creepy, crawly 
Creepy, crawly 
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly 
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly 
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly 
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly 

There he is wrapped in a ball 
Doesn't seem to move at all 
Perhaps he's dead, I'll just make sure 
Pick this book up off the floor 

Boris the spider 
Boris the spider 

Creepy, crawly 
Creepy, crawly 
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly 
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly 
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly 
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly 

He's come to a sticky end 
Don't think he will ever mend 
Never more will he crawl 'round 
He's embedded in the ground 

Boris the spider 
Boris the spider


I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna'bring'you down, no
I'will always be the one to'speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown, no

We're laid in
I'm so happy that it's raining out again
I'm so made up that we're naked in our bed
Like we were 24 back when

Who will hammer out?
The deeper question needin' sorting out
If there's an answer, we will find it with our doubt
We're a little more than friends

We fell through time and space
And cast upon this place
And so far we've been saved

I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down, no
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown, no

I never wanna bring you down, no
I never wanna bring you down

It's raining out
I'm so made up, we've been makin' out
Watching movies in our dressing gowns
Like we were 24 or there about

What matters most?
Life's amazing but it's been a bumpy road
No more than lately, things have been a little wild
Am I an adult or a child?
Don't feel any different now

We watch the world go by
And so far we've been fine

I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down, no
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown, no
I never wanna bring you down

We fell through time and space
We chanced upon this place
And so far, we've been saved

I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown, no
I never wanna bring you down

I will always be the one to break the news, if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down, no
I will always be the one to speak the truth, if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown
Never wanna see you down
Never wanna see you down, no


Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T,
Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T,
Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T,
Found her in a barn in Tennessee
I paid five bucks for my Bucket T
Took me three years of sweat and blood
To clean off all that Tennessee mud

[Chorus:]
My Bucket T (Bucket T)
Bucket T (Bucket T)
My Bucket T (Bucket T)
My Bucket T (Bucket T)
T T T... Bucket bucket bucket...

Cruise down the street in front of school
I want to rev it up but I gotta be cool
Drivin' down the road I'll get my kicks
A'poppin' the clutch and a'slippin' the sticks

[Chorus]

I was right, too, she's first in her class
There's nothing on the freeway she don't pass
All the girls want to take a ride with me
But there's only one seat in my Bucket T

[Chorus]


Did you ever sleep in a bear pit
Did you ever sleep in a bear pit
With apple cores and mice along
With apple cores and mice along?
Did you ever lay on ice and grit
Did you ever lay on ice and grit
Or search for a place where the wind was gone
Or search for a place where the wind was gone?

Did you ever tramp up endless hills
Did you ever tramp up endless hills
Past cozy homes with secret beds
Past cozy homes with secret beds?
Did you ever dream of a suicide pill
Did you ever dream of a suicide pill
And wake up cold to the smell of bread
And wake up cold to the smell of bread?

Well, I have slept there badly twice
Well, I have slept there badly twice
And shared my straw with scratchin' mice
And shared my straw with scratchin' mice
Although you'll find some deep brown hair
Although you'll find some deep brown hair
I'll tell you something for nothing
I'll tell you something for nothing
There ain't no bears in there (cache, cache)

Did you ever have to make a draw
Did you ever have to make a draw
For a hard wooden bench or a bed of stone
For a hard wooden bench or a bed of stone?
Did you ever jemmy a stable door
Did you ever jemmy a stable door
Or scare the horse to escape the snow
Or scare the horse to escape the snow?

Did you ever invade a neat little yard
Did you ever invade a neat little yard
Wake up the children who hope for ghosts
Wake up the children who hope for ghosts?
Did you ever cause their dogs to bark

Their guests to curse their noisy hosts

Don't jump in expectin' fun

Don't swagger in there with your elephant gun

Did you ever wonder why music hurts

When someone plays it aloof to sin

Did you ever believe that a smile could cure

A happy face, keep you warm at night

Were you ever fooled by laughter's lure
Were you ever fooled by laughter's lure
Only to find that they laughed in spite

Did you ever finally find a place
Did you ever finally find a place
A soft warm bed in a room of flowers

And when you finally laid down your face
And when you finally laid down your face
You found you slept for a hundred hours

See that girl who's smiling so brightly,
Well I reckon she's cool and I reckon rightly,
She's good looking and I ain't frightened,
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning

Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly,
My XKE is shining so brightly,
The noose around us is slowly tightening,
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning

Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly,
My XKE is shining so brightly,
The noose around us is slowly tightening,
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning

You can't catch me, I'm as fast as can be,
Call me lightning, I'm as fast as can be,
No you can't catch me, no you can't catch me, woo lightning


Captain Walker
Didn't come home
His unborn child
Will never know him
We believe him missing
With a number of men
Don't expect
To see him again
He's believed to be missing
With a number of men
Don't expect
To see him again


NORA:
Today it rained champagne
A son was born again
A genius unchained
A life of wealth and fame, wealth and fame

Champagne flowing down just like rain
Caviar breakfasts every day
Merchant banks and yachts at Cannes
Servants and cars and private sand

TOMMY:
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me, heal me

NORA:
They flock in thousands strong
We'll just play along
A million in reserve
For love, a just deserve, just deserve
Francs and dollars and peacock's wings
Sequined gowns and birds that sing
Private planes and fishing lakes
Bigger crowds and bigger, bigger, bigger takes

But what's it all worth?

What's it all worth when my son is blind?
He can't hear the music
Nor enjoy what I'm buying
His life is worthless
Affecting mine
I'd pay any price
To drive his plight from my mind

TOMMY:
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me


Did you ever see the faces of the children
They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including heaven's generosity
Peeping round the door
To see what parcels are for free
In curiosity

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was
Or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

Surrounded by his friends
He sits so silently
And unaware of anything
Playing poxy pinball,
Picks his nose and smiles and
Pokes his tongue at everything
I believe in love
But how can men who've never seen
Light be enlightened
Only if he's cured
Will his spirits future level ever heighten

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was
Or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
How can he be saved?

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me!
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me!

Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Can you, can you, can you hear me?
How can he be saved?

Did you ever see the faces of the children
They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including heaven's generosity
Peeping round the door
To see what parcels are for free
In curiosity

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was
Or what praying is
How can he be saved

Circles
My head is going 'round in circles
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool
Draggin' me down

Time
Will tell if I'll take the homeward track
Dizziness will make my feet walk back
Walk right back to you

Everything I do
I think of you
No matter how I try
I can't get back

Circles
Leading me back to you

Round and around and around
And around and around
And around and around
And around and around

Round and round and round
Like a fool I go
Down and down in the pool I go
Draggin' me down

Everything I do
I think of you
No matter how I try
I can't get back

Circles
Leading me back to you

Just one thing could kill the pain
Of leaving you
But it gets me so dizzy that I'm walkin' right back again
Back to you

Time
Will tell if these dreams are ? fact
Though I left I'm comin' back
Comin' on home to you

People are sufferin'
I say it again
People are sufferin'
I say it again
People are sufferin'
I say it again
So remember when you're looking for trouble
That trouble is already busy with weaker men

People are hungry
I say it again
People are hungry
I say it again
People are hungry
I say it again
So don't you abuse that body
It'll snap without assistance my friends

Song goes on
(I'll sing again until the music enervates)
Song goes on
(The sting of pain will dull and finally fade away)
Song goes on
(Through centuries of history it reverberates)
Song goes on
(On curving comets track the music makes it's way)
This song is so long
It ends up where it begins

People are lonely
I say it again
People are lonely
I say it again
People are lonely
I say it again
So don't let me run too far from home
You be alone for sure, on that you can depend

People are bleedin'
I'll say it again
People are bleedin'
I'll say it again
People are bleedin'
I'll say it again
So put away that switchblade knife
Tighten up that'll help this bloodshed end

Song goes on
The song goes on
The song goes on
The song goes on
This song is so long
It ends up where it begins

People are sufferin'
(I say it again, again, again, again)
People are hungry
(I say it again, again, again, again)
People are lonely
(I say it again, again, again, again)
(Again, again, again, again)
('Gain, again, again, again, again)

We're on our own, cousin
All alone, cousin
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grown-ups have all gone away
You won't be much fun
Being blind, deaf and dumb
But I've no-one to play with today
Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?
To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair
You won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do with a freak
How would you feel if I
Turned on the bath
Ducked your head under
And started to laugh?
What would you do if I shut you outside
To stand in the rain
And catch cold so you died?

I'm the school bully!
The classroom cheat
The nasty play friend
You ever could meet
I'll stick pins in your fingers
And tread on your feet

We're on our own, cousin
All alone, cousin
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grown-ups have all gone away
You won't be much fun
Being blind, deaf and dumb
But I've no-one to play with today
Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?
To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair
You won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do with a freak

Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Would change your expression
To one of alarm
I'll drag you around by a lock of your hair
Or give you a push
At the top of the stairs

I'm the school bully!
The classroom cheat
The nasty play friend
You ever could meet
I'll put glass in your dinner
And spikes in your seat


{Cousin Kevin:}

Were on our own cousin,
all alone cousin.
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away.
You won't be much fun
being blind deaf and dumb
But I've no one to play with today.
D'you know how to play hide and seek?
To find me it would take you a week,
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do to a freak.
How would you feel if I turned on the bath,
Ducked your head under and started to laugh.
What would you do if I shut you outside,
To stand in the rain
and catch cold so you died?

I'm the school bully !
The classroom cheat.
The nastiest play friend,
You ever could meet.
I'll stick pins in your fingers
And tread on your feet...

Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Would change your expression to one of alarm,
I'll drag you around by a lock of your hair
Or give you a push at the top of the stairs...

I'm the school bully !
The classroom cheat.
The nastiest play friend,
You ever could meet.
I'll put glass in your dinner
And spikes in your seat...


Once it was just innocence
Brash ideas and insolence
But you will never get away
With the things you say today

But you can try if you want

Don't you get embarrassed when you read the precious things you said
Many many years ago when life appeared rosy red
No one ever shared your bed
Nothing ever filled your head
Except yourself and little Ted
And scary dreams that you were dead.
Don't you want to hide your face
When going through your teenage books
And read the kind of crap you wrote
About "ban the bomb" and city crooks
Think about how long it took
To get over that sudden "Yuk"
When in the mirror you would look
Well now my son you're well in stook

Cry if you want, cry if you want

Didn't you writhe in anger when you saw the man in his big car
Didn't you drive a banger and a gallon didn't get you far
Should have been a famous star
But that ain't what you really are
You could shout your last hurrah

While they are propping up the bar
Maybe things were better then
Before you led a promised life
Rash commitments and heavy raps and left wing spiel all compromised
You fall in love with other's wives
Drive 'em nuts with empty lies
Angry 'cause you lost the prize
Forgot the color of their eyes.

Cry if you want, cry if you want

Let your tears flow Let your past go

Don't you get embarrassed when you think about the way you were
Yesterday the day before when you were young with much to learn
Aren't you glad it's your last term
No more acting lowly worm
You can make the suckers squirm
When you tell them how much you earn
Don't you feel ashamed at all the bitterness you keep inside
Does your ego save your face "I had a go - I really tried"
Now you know your leaders lied
Does it stop you acting snide
Or are you still a boy that cried
Tears now surely long since dried.

Cry if you want, cry if you want


Why should I care
If I have to cut my hair?
I've got to move with the fashion
Or be outcast
I know I should fight
But my old man he's really alright
And I'm still living at home
Even though it won't last

Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
I'm dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling is still
Here in my brain

The kids at school
Have parents that seem so cool
And though I don't want to hurt them
Mine want me their way
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll let me stay

Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
I'm dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling is still
Here in my brain

Why do I have to be different to them?
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend
We have the same old row, again and again
Why do I have to move with a crowd
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around
I work myself to death just to fit in

I'm coming down
Got home on the very first train from town
My dad just left for work
He wasn't talking
It's all a game
And inside I'm just the same
My fried egg makes me sick
First thing in the morning


Girl you think you've had loving,
Girl you think you've had fun,
Girl you ain't a seen nothin' 'til I come along.

I'm a daddy, I'm a daddy, I'm a daddy,
Yeah I'm a daddy daddy I'm daddy rolling stone.

I got a friend named Cody,
He's got a girl named Chris,
I'm gonna steal that girl though he's twice my size,
'Cause I know how to do it like this.

I'm a daddy, I'm a daddy, I'm a daddy,
Yeah I'm a daddy daddy I'm daddy rolling stone,
I'm daddy rolling stone, I'm daddy rolling stone,
Daddy rolling stone, call me daddy rolling stone.

I said I got a friend named Cody,
He's got a girl named Chris,
I'm gonna steal that girl though he's twice my size,
'Cause I know how to do it like this.

I'm a daddy, I'm a daddy, I'm a daddy, daddy,
I'm daddy rolling stone, I'm daddy rolling stone,
Just call me daddy rolling stone dear,
Long hair long nose, daddy rolling stone.

Danny laid back and surveyed the view
A king on his bench, he was cold, he'was'blue
I asked for'permission to give him a note
He'nodded, not movin', just scratched at his throat

Always smiled slightly, seemed so bemused
Like he was the one, who was glad to be used
I had a sense he was playin' a part
But I had to help, for he tore at my heart

He would walk, his feet wrapped in rags
He wandered the neighborhood, carrying his bags
The pride in his eyes would so clearly flash
Like I was the one who needed the cash

The tramps in our England, have always to walk
From Philip to Dorchester, fifteen miles strong
The tramps in our country have no where's to hug
Home hysterics give comfort, there's no time to talk

Danny would lay, he'd never speak
Here was a man who had attained his peak
No fables to tell, and nothing held back
This was a man who had led a strong path

Old soldier, perhaps, or a worn, old jailbird
Who'd never a hand clean and never a word
For two hundred down, my project had fled
Danny was gone, or may well have been dead

He walked slowly, no hurryin' to death
Took in turn his view with his very last breath
The river, the mist and the slightly grey sky
Danny was waiting, patient to die

The tramps in our England, have always to walk
From Philip to Dorchester, fifteen miles strong
The tramps in our country have no where's to hug
Home hysterics give comfort, there's no time to talk

Danny laid back, looked down and the plain
The king on his bench with magnificent mane
I asked his permission to give him a note
He nodded, not movin', just scratched at his throat

It's dangerous to faction as those who live rough
Danny was a giant, solid and tough
He allowed me to gift him and scribble this song
Without bein' draconian, he lived just as long


[Intro]
(Detour, detour)
Ooh, we got to make a detour
(Detour, detour)

[Verse 1]
When people try to crash right down
Shoot'at'the sky, craze'with rage
We're all good people if'you go deep down
But we gotta be in keeping with the brand new age

[Pre-Chorus]
Time for a detour
We oughta take the curb (Detour now)
Taking the detour
It's time to swerve (Detour now)

[Bridge]
The world's in a spin now
It's time for a change
We know we can win now
We'll share the ways, we cause no pain
We can't explain, we lost the force, we went off course

[Chorus]
Oooh, we need a detour (Detour)
With a curve and swerve
Mmm, detour

[Verse 2]
Forget that fall from back in the days
And the power we saw as we took the stage
Made it 15 years till we found our ways
Adolescent fears as we turn the page

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta take a detour, the road is blocked
Time for a detour, ooh, the gates are locked

[Bridge]
We're finally tracking in the path of the groove
We're willingly backing the path of the moon
There'll be no more pain
We can't explain, we found the force, we're back on course

[Chorus]
We need a detour
Don't hit the detour
With a curve and swerve
Ah, detour

[Bridge]
Used to say I love you but I was straight insane
I always left you holding the weight of my pain
'Cause I couldn't stay for even one more day
I'd work too hard
I couldn't share the [?]
Then I ran away

[Verse 3]
When people try to crash right down
Shoot at the sky, craze with rage
We're all good people if you go deep down
But we gotta be in keeping with the brand new age

[Pre-Chorus]
Time for a detour
We oughta take the curb (Detour now)
Making a detour
It's time for a swerve (Detour now)

[Bridge]
The world is spinning
It's time for a change
We know we ain't winning
We'll share the ways, we cause no pain
We can't explain, we lost the force, we went off course

[Chorus]
Oooh, we need a detour
Oh, got to have a detour
With a curve and swerve
Ooh, we need a detour

(Detour)
Take the curve and the swerve
Ooh, detour
We need a detour


I wake up on broken glass
I wake up on broken glass
But you left your number
But you left your number
All the members of the cast
All the members of the cast
Reckon I was lumbered
Reckon I was lumbered

Did you steal it
Did you steal it
Did you screw me
Did you screw me
Did you peel it

Are you out there Mr no-one
Are you out there Mr no-one
Is my investment growing

Sorry that I got so drunk
Sorry that I got so drunk
But I wrote you a poem
But I wrote you a poem

Did you search me
Did you search me
Did you turn me over
Did you turn me over
While I cold turkeyed
While I cold turkeyed
On the sofa
On the sofa

Did you steal my money
Did you steal my money

How can we forgive a grievance
How can we forgive a grievance
Now that we all live with demons
Now that we all live with demons
Did you know that poor old veteran
Did you know that poor old veteran
That you kicked out of his bed
That you kicked out of his bed

Says that he cannot forget you
Says that he cannot forget you
But he does not wish you dead
But he does not wish you dead
Leave his gold watch in reception
Leave his gold watch in reception
He will keep the sixteen stitches in his head
He will keep the sixteen stitches in his head
Did you steal his money
Did you steal his money

Did you pinch my trainer football
Did you pinch my trainer football
Say if you half inched it
Say if you half inched it
Thought I heard a female foot fall
Thought I heard a female foot fall
While I washed my kitchen
While I washed my kitchen

Did you use me
Did you use me
Why'd I trust you
Why'd I trust you
Why'd you abuse me
Why'd you abuse me
I won't bust you
I won't bust you

Did you steal my lorry
Did you steal my lorry
It fell right off my lorry
It fell right off my lorry

Did you pinch my brasso
Did you pinch my brasso
Nick my belt you asshole
Nick my belt you asshole


We old ones have seen two wars
We old ones have seen two wars

When you're sick and afraid
And there's danger around
Take a pick and a spade
And cut into the ground
(Cut into the ground)

Away from the light
Away from the sound
Make a trap for the beast
Dig his burial mound
(Dig his burial mound)

Dig for your life
Dig to the death
Dig for salvation
Till your very last breath

Dig for protection
Dig for release
Dig for resurrection
And dig it for peace

We old ones have seen two wars

When you dream of a laser
That sears your soul
Slices like a razor
And Burns like a coal
(And burns like a coal)

You can bet you'll forget
When the rock starts to roll
And the last meets the least
By the watering hole
(By the watering hole)

Dig it down deep
Dig it out wide
Dig it for pleasure
Dig it for pride

Dig it for treasure
Dig it for stones
Dig it for the metal
And dig for the bones

Dig it down
Dig it down
Dig it down

Dig it down deep
Dig it out wide
Dig it for pleasure
Dig it for pride

Dig it for treasure
Dig it for stones
Dig it for the metal
And dig for the bones
Dig it

We old ones have seen two wars
We old ones have seen two wars

Dig it down deep
Dig it out wide
Dig it for pleasure
Dig it for pride

Dig it for treasure
Dig it for stones
Dig it for the metal
And dig for the bones

Dig for your life
Dig to the death
Dig for salvation
Till your very last breath

Dig for protection
Dig for release
Dig for resurrection
And dig for peace

We old ones have seen two wars



I used to know everything about you
But today when I tried to point you out to one of my friends
I picked the wrong girl again
Don't see you in the crowd anymore
I think it's you, but I can't be sure
You're wearing disguises
Occasionally a girl surprises me
When she turns out to be you
Wearing disguises

I don't think you want me to see you ever again
And today I saw you dressed as a flower bed

Last week you had a wig on your head
Directing traffic in the street
And your shoes were too big for your feet
You were wearing disguises
Occasionally a girl surprises me
When she turns out to be you
Wearing disguises

I used to know everything about you
But today when I tried to point you out to one of my friends
I picked the wrong girl again
Don't see you in the crowd anymore
I think it's you, but I can't be sure
You're wearing disguises
Occasionally a girl surprises me
When she turns out to be you
Wearing disguises

Wearing disguises
Wearing disguises
Wearing disguises
Wearing disguises

Laugh and say I'm green
I've seen things you'll never see
Talk behind my back
I'm off the beaten track
I'll take on anyone
Ain't scared of a bloody nose
Drink 'til I drop down
With one eye on my clothes

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she?

Got a bet there?

Getting high?

Tore up my Levis

Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down

The first time we met you were a kennel maid,
You gave me a tip I got me forecast paid,
You were holding a greyhound in trap number one,
Your white coat was shining in the afternoon sun.

Now we're both together,
We're never gonna break apart, no no,
'Cause we're a happy couple you and me,
With a greyhound at either knee.

I'll have ten shillings to win on Camera Flash, young man,
What dog's that, it's a deuce, look at it.

There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,
'Ceptin' you, little darling,
'Ceptin' you, little darling,
We're a happy couple you and me,
With a greyhound at either knee.

We go to the dog track on Saturday night,
We put all our money on a dog that we like,
A kiss and a cuddle, a hot meat pie,
Two dollar tickets and a starry sky.

There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,
'Ceptin' you, little darling,
'Ceptin' you, little darling,
We're a happy couple you and me,
With a baby on either knee.

Yes it's you little darling,
Yes it's you little darling,
Now it's you little darling,
Now it's you.

Girl, where's me wage packet ?????,
Ah I'll put twenty-five knicker please on Gallop Printer,
Oh, I hope the wife don't find out,
Yes, it's sure to win, isn't it,
Yes, I know, it's a good dog, I saw it run at White City,
Just last week, broke the record, Gallop Printer,
Nice dog, yes, lovely form, lovely buttocks.


[Instrumental]


I can't be held responsible for blown behavior
I can't be held responsible for blown behavior
I lost all contact with my only savior
I lost all contact with my only savior
No one locked me out because I failed to phone up
No one locked me out because I failed to phone up
I can't bear to live forever like a loner
I can't bear to live forever like a loner

Don't let go the coat
Don't let go the coat

It's easy to be sad when you lack a partner
It's easy to be sad when you lack a partner
But how would I react to a broken heart now?
But how would I react to a broken heart now?
It ain't really true rock and roll unless I'm
It ain't really true rock and roll unless I'm
Hanging onto you, and when I hold it next time
Hanging onto you, and when I hold it next time

I won't let go the coat
I won't let go the coat

I try to explain, but you never understand it
I try to explain, but you never understand it
I need your body, but I can't just demand it
I need your body, but I can't just demand it
I won't let go like a stray at heel

I won't let go like a stray at heel
(Never let it out of your sight)
(Never let it out of your sight)
Every lonely wife knows the way I feel
Every lonely wife knows the way I feel
(Don't let go tonight)
(Don't let go tonight)
Don't let go the coat
Don't let go the coat
Never let go the coat
Never let go the coat

Your friends all pass for life is just a market
Your friends all pass for life is just a market
But you have to finish everything you started
But you have to finish everything you started
So I live my life tearing down the runway
So I live my life tearing down the runway
Sure to get the hang of hanging in there someday
Sure to get the hang of hanging in there someday

Don't let go the coat
Don't let go the coat
Won't get no more chances; forget the war dances
Won't get no more chances; forget the war dances
Go blind and hang on; don't try the slang, son
Go blind and hang on; don't try the slang, son
Never let go the coat
Never let go the coat


Don't go and hide
Yesterday you were my girlfriend
If you do
My inside goes around and around in a whirlwind

There's a stone in my shoe
So I can't catch you up
My head's in a lion's mouth
Wants to eat me up
Right here today
Don't look away
I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away

I once heard you say
If I ever was down you would help me
Now my head's being chewed up
You pretend that you don't see

There's a stone in my shoe
So I can't catch you up
My head's in a lion's mouth
Wants to eat me up
Right here today
Don't look away
I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away

I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away


Hyde, Hyde.
Someone is spending my money for me,
The money I earn I never see,
In all things I do he interferes,
All I know is trouble as soon as he appears.

Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.
When I drink my potion my character changes,
My whole mind and body rearranges,
This strange transformation takes place in me,
Instead of myself everybody can see...

Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.
Whenever you're with me make sure it's still me,
I've got to the stage I can't tell which I'll be,
The loveable fellow who'll buy you a drink,
Then when he's drunk his he'll change in a wink into...

Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.


Laugh and say I'm green
I've seen things you'll never see
Talk behind my back
I'm off the beaten track
I'll take on anyone
Ain't scared of a bloody nose
Drink 'til I drop down
With one eye on my clothes

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she? 
I'll rape it
Got a bet there? 
I'll meet it
Getting high? 
You can't beat it

Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

You say she's a virgin
But I'm gonna be the first in
Her fellah's gonna kill me?
Oh fucking will he
I'm seeing double
But don't miss me if you can
There's gonna be trouble
When she chooses her man

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she? 
I'll rape it
Got a bet there? 
I'll meet it
Getting high? 
You can't beat it

Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim 
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

Is it me? 
For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

Is it me? 
For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

I'm going back soon
Home to get the baboon
Who cut up my eye
Tore up my Levis
I'm feeling restless
Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she? 
I'll rape it
Got a bet there? 
I'll meet it
Getting high? 
You can't beat it

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she? 
I'll rape it

Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim 
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

Is it me? 
For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

Is it me? 
For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling


I feel like I want to break out of the house
My heart is a-pumping, I've got sand in my mouth
I feel like I'm heading up to a cardiac arrest
I want to scream in the night, I want a manifest

I've got that wide awake, give-and-take, five o'clock-in-the-morning feeling
I've got the hots for the sluts in the well thumbed pages of a magazine
I want to drive, want to fly like I do in the dreams I've never really been in
I want to hump, want to jump, want to heat up, cool down in a dream machine

I'm dreaming... from the waist on down
I'm dreaming... but I feel tired and bound
I'm dreaming... of a day when a cold shower helps my health
I'm dreaming... dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself

Sound like a priest and then I'm shooting dice
I'm burning tires with some guy whose hair is turning white
I know the girls that I pass, they just ain't impressed
I'm too old to give up, but too young to rest

I've got that numb-to-a-thumb over-dubbed
Feeling social when the world is sleeping
The plot starts to thicken then I sicken and I feel I'm cemented down
I'm so juiced that the whorey lady's sad sad story has me quietly weeping
But here comes the morning
Here comes the yawning demented clown

I'm dreaming...but I know it's all hot air
I'm dreaming...I'll get back to that rocking chair
I'm dreaming...of the day I can share the wealth
I'm dreaming...dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself
Hey, hey!
The day I can control myself


There are men high up there fishing
Haven't seen quite enough of the world
Ooh, I ain't seen a sign of my heroes
And I'm still diving down for pearls

Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy and let me be calm
Let the tide in, and set me free

I'm flowing under bridges
Then flying through the sky
I'm traveling down cold metal
Just a tear in a baby's eye

Oh, let me flow into the ocean
Oh, let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy and let me be calm
Let the tide in, and set me free

Set me free 
I am not the actor
This can't be the scene
But I am in the water
As far as I can see

Oh, I'm remembering distant memories
Recalling other names
Rippling over canyons
And boiling in the train

Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy and let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
Set me free
Set me free
I wanna drown
In cold water

Oh


Hi there, 3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,
With life's best side on the downward slope,
It's in my own hands, I know I'll cope,
My girl's with me and all my friends can see

Here I am again,
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi

Done it before, do it again,
Know from experience it's not in vain,
She's the best I've had, I cannot see, what someone else can do to me
It's a long way home but love's so warm, you'll see

Here I am again,
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi

Early morning cold taxi,
Each time I do it, I feel so down and out,
Early morning cold taxi,
Though my mind thinks strange I'll keep on, no doubt

3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,
One day we'll be wed,
This I know for it's what she said,
Then no more will my mind be uneasy

Early morning cold taxi,
Each time I do it, I feel so down and out,
Early morning cold taxi,
Though my mind thinks strange I'll keep on, no doubt

3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,
One day we'll be wed,
This I know for it's what she said,
Then no more will my mind be uneasy

Here I am again,
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi


The sun shines
And people forget
The spray flies as the speedboat glides
And people forget
Forget they're hiding
The girls smile
And people forget
The snow packs as the skier tracks
People forget
Forget they're hiding

Behind an eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put on
It's an eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put on
An eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put on
Eminence front
It's an eminence front 
It's an eminence front, it's a put on
It's a put on, it's a put on, it's a put on

Come and join the party
Dress to kill
Won't you come and join the party
Dress to kill, dress to kill

Drinks flow
People forget
That big wheel spins, the hair thins
People forget
Forget they're hiding
The news slows
People forget
Their shares crash, hopes are dashed
People forget
Forget they're hiding

Behind an eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put on
It's just an eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put on
An eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put on
Eminence front 
It's an eminence front, it's a put on
It's a put on, it's a put on, it's a put on

Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to kill
Dress yourself, dressed to kill


Why was I born today
Life is useless like Ecclesiastes say
I never had a chance
But opportunity's now in my hands

I stand with my guitar
All I need's a mirror
Then I'm a star
I'm so sick of dud TV
Next time you switch on
You might see me
(Oh, what a thrill for you)

I've been there and gone there
I've lived there and bummed there
I've spinned there, I gave there
I drank there and I slaved there

I've had enough of the way things been done
Every man on a razors edge
Someone has used us to shoot with the same gun
Killing each other by driving a wedge

My life's a mess I wait for you to pass
I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass

Why was I born today
Life is useless like Ecclesiastes say
I didn't get a chance
Opportunity's in my hand

Then I'm a star

Next time you switch on

I've spinned there, I gave there

I've had enough of the way things have been done
Every man on a razors edge
Someone has used us to shoot with the same gun
We where killing each other by driving a wedge

My life's a mess I wait for you to pass
I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass

Don't worry smile and dance
You just can work life out
Don't let down moods entrance you
Take the wine and shout [x2]

My life's a mess I wait for you to pass
I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass


We found this pile of paper
Written by that ether man
He hatched a mad old caper
He had a mad old plan

He'd turn us into music
He'd show us to our portals
He gathered wire and angels
To entertain immortals

Out on the endless wire


NEWSBOYS:

Extra extra, pinball bonanza
Deaf, dumb and blind kid makes the big game
Saturday final he faces the champ

Extra extra
Pinball big time
Million in hand!
You can rule the world from a yacht in the bay

Champagne flowing down
A popular man
Pinball, let's play
Tommy keeps a-winnin'
He's a millionaire
Mamma's got a brand new Cadillac
Hurry to the show
We're nearly on the air
Extra! Extra!


You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind

You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Her daddy gave her magic,
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she start to shakin'
The dumb begin to talk

She's got the power to heal you, never fear!
She's got the power to heal you, never fear!
Just a word from her lips
And the deaf begin to hear


We've got to face the face
You must have heard the cautionary tales
The dangers hidden on the cul-de-sac trails
From wiser men who have been through it all
And the ghosts of failures spray-canned up on the wall
We've got to judge the judge
Got to find the finds
We've got to scheme the schemes
Have to line the lines
We must stake the stakes
And show the shown
We must take the takes
And know the known
Try to place the place
Where we can face the face
Face the face, got to
Face the face
You must have tried and the defied belief
Maybe found futility in insular grief

I need your hunger just as you need mine
A million appetites can swallow up time
We've got to fool the fools
And plan the plans
We must rule the rules
Got to stand the stands
We must fight the fight
And fall the falls
We must light the light
And call the calls
We must race the race
So we can face the face
New York! Chicago!
London and Glasgow!
Keep looking!
Keep on cooking
Keep on looking
Gotta stay on this case
Study the picks
Watch the fix
We've got to find the face
Try to place the place where we can face the face


It may be warm but the snow is going to fall,
Enough to cover us all.
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again.

We've got to have faith in something bigger,
Faith in something bigger,
Faith in something big inside yourself.

It might be cold but the heat of our love will melt,
The snow we never felt.
We're young and hardy again, we bow to weaker men.

We've got to have faith in something bigger,
Faith in something bigger,
Faith in something big inside yourself.

The more we learn, the less we believe to be true.
The more we prove, the more remains to be proved.
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again.

We've got to have faith in something bigger,
Faith in something bigger,
Faith in something big inside yourself, inside yourself.

Faith in something bigger (x 8)


Uncle Ernie:

I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !

Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Fiddling about
Fiddling about
Fiddle about!

Down with the bedclothes
Up with the nightshirt!
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !

You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !
Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.


You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Ayy, girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Mmm, the time for hesitation's through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Darling ,we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Well, you know that it would be untrue
And you know that I would be a liar
If I was to go and tell you
Mama, we couldn't get much higher

Yeah, come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Yeah, try to set the night on fire
Ayy, hey, hey, come on, baby, light, light my fire

Yeah, come on, babe, light my fire
Don't you know it's alright?
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
Oh, light my fire, light my fire, light my fire

Yeah girl, girl, you better light my fire
Yeah, you better light, you better light
You better light my fire
And we are going to get much higher

Oh, oh, come on, girl, you know I love you, girl
You know I need you, babe, come on
Light, light, light, light my fire, light my fire
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire

Light my fire, light, light, light, light
Light my, my, my, my fire, light, light, light, light
Light my fire, girl, you better light my fire




Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said "Son, do you feel kind of warm?"
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said "You're in love"

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
How she made a fool out of me

At last something shook me
As if it came down from above
And now the fortune teller
And I fell in love


They kicked me out [Repeat: x4]

You must've heard of them, a kind of screwed-up blend
Split personality
Two sides to fight and argue all night
over coffee or tea

Well, that's okay, I wouldn't mind, two say
or even three, and that's no joke
But with a four-way split, the pocket money's hit
And all of me is broke

I got four heads inside my mind
Four rooms I'd like to lie in
Four selves I want to find
And I don't know which one is me

I get four papers in the box each day
Four girls ringing that I'm trying to date
I look in the mirror and see my face
But I don't know which one is me (I don't know which one is me)

He kicked me out, He kicked me out
He kicked me out, He kicked me out

I wake up over here and then I'm over here
I'm trying to brush my teeth
It's little things that are hard
Like starting up the car when I'm still underneath

I get along alright, in fact it's fun at night
I get four-dimensional dreams
But I have to think before I take a drink
I get hungover times sixteen

There are four records I want to buy
Four highs I'd like to try
Every letter I get I send four replies
And they don't know which one's from me

I've got four hang-ups I'm trying to beat
Four directions and just two feet
I've got a very very secret identity
And I don't know which one is me

You think it's funny, I can tell
Well, you don't understand too well
I get so lonely and turned around
But I can't let it bring me down

I got four hang-ups I'm trying to beat
Four directions and just two feet
Got a very very secret identity
And I don't know which one is me


Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life

We are tiny pieces
Falling now and settling

The parts of me

I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well
With the chords I'm playing
I can't pretend there's any meaning here
Or in the things I'm saying

But I'm in tune
Right in tune
I'm in tune
And I'm gonna tune

Right in on you
Right in on you
Right in on you

I get a little tired of having to say
"Do you come here often?"
But when I look in your eyes and see the harmonies
And the heartaches soften

I'm getting in tune
Right in tune
I'm in tune
And I'm gonna tune

Right in on you (right in on you)
Right in on you (right in on you)
Right in on you

I've got it all here in my head
There's nothing more needs to be said
I'm just bangin' on my old piano
I'm getting in tune with the straight and narrow

(Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)
Getting in tune with the straight and narrow
(Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)
Yeah, I'm getting in tune with the straight and narrow
(Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)

I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well
With the way I'm feeling
There's a symphony that I hear in your heart
Sets my head a-reeling

But I'm in tune
Right in tune
I'm in tune
And I'm gonna tune

Right in on you (right in on you)
Right in on you (right in on you)
Right in on you

Baby, with you
Baby, with you
Baby, with you
Baby, with you
Baby, with you

I've got it all here in my head
There's nothing more needs to be said

Hello
Girl's eyes, butterflies, how she cries, can't get through to you
She knows all the charts, breaks her heart, thinks a lot of you

Each time you play a melody
It means the earth to this little girl
Can you be cruel and break her heart
Tear her small world apart?

She's there, eyes aglow, very front row, don't throw sticks at her
Please don't look her way, see her way, don't care anyway

It's you who led her on, I see
Just leave her down in her misery
She don't want help from you and me
Can't tell a note from a symphony

It's you who led her on, I see
Just leave her down in her misery
She don't want help from you and me
Can't tell a note from a symphony

Girl's eyes, butterflies, how she cries, can't get through to you
She knows all the charts, breaks her heart, thinks a lot of you

Each time you play a melody
It means the earth to this little girl
Can you be cruel and break her heart
Tear her small world apart?

Odorono
Could have saved her day, could have helped her to get the part
Odorono
And he would have stayed, and helped her to save her heart
Save her heart


She wasn't a fool
That glittering girl
She followed the rules
That shimmering pearl

Said the rules mama preaches
Go down when they break
The things mama teaches
You just gotta shake

But she wasn't a fool
That slender love figure
She followed her rules
And made money bigger

She wasn't a fool
That shining young woman
She followed her rules
She's crying for no man

Said the rules mama teaches
Go down when they're broken
She explodes into peaches
And cries when I've spoken

She wasn't a fool
That goddess of hell
There are no mother's rules
She makes them herself

And I was down upon my knees
To beg her surrender up to me

Something inside her
Told her she shouldn't
Tried and enlight her
But the girl wouldn't

She wasn't a fool
But love flowed from her face
She's not scared of me
She's afraid of disgrace

She wasn't a fool
That female for our world
She followed her rules
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl


Separates and lingerie, seven pairs of shoes
Lots of Woolworth's makeup, a pair of Blackwatch trews
Your out-of-tune piano, sentimental photographs
A million little memories, a million little laughs

The wing of the airplane has just caught on fire
I say without reservation we ain't getting no higher

All you wanted from me, all I had to give
Nothing matters you'll see, when in paradise you live

The plane is diving faster, we're getting near the ground
Nobody is screaming, no one makes a sound

It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl (Mrs. Walker, it's a girl)
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl (Mrs. Walker, it's a girl)
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl (Mrs. Walker, it's a girl)


He seems to be completely unreceptive
The tests I gave him show no sense at all
His eyes react to light the dials detect it
He hears but cannot answer to your call

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

There is no chance no untried operation
All hope lies with him and none with me
Imagine though the shock from isolation
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

His eyes can see
His ears can hear his lips speak
All the time the needles flick and rock
No machine can give the kind of stimulation
Needed to remove his inner block

Go to the mirror boy!
Go to the mirror boy!

I often wonder what he is feeling
Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head?

Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet!

Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story

What is happening in his head
Ooooh I wish I knew, I wish I knew


And when the world began
I'd been asleep forever
I opened one eye
'Twas then it was I
Got the whim to wake

And when the weight of space
Rolled like it was an ocean
One became one
Father and son
Watched the sunrise break

And as the ocean warmed
And from this dream we woke
One sang to greet the dawn
One pursed his lips and spoke

Wake up and hear the music
Wake up and hear the music play
Wake up and hear the music
Wake up and hear what the people say

I heard the heavens sing
Predicting Marty Robbins
I knew I'd find
Music and time
Were the perfect plan

I watched my son sail on
A little ship a-bobbin'
I had to grow
I needed to know
Exactly who I am

And as the ocean warmed
And from this dream we woke
One sang to greet the dawn
One pursed his lips and spoke

Wake up and hear the music
Wake up and hear the music play
Wake up and hear the music
Wake up and hear what the people say

Wake up and hear the music
Wake up and hear the music play
Wake up and hear the music
Wake up and hear what the people say


I'm goin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground

She's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground

I'm goin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground


I'm goin' home
And when I want to go home
I'm goin' mobile
Well, I'm gonna find a home
And we'll see how it feels
Goin' mobile
Keep me movin'

I can pull up by the curb
I can make it on the road
Goin' mobile
I can stop in any street
And talk with people that we meet
Goin' mobile
Keep me movin'

Out in the woods
Or in the city
It's all the same to me
When I'm drivin' free, the world's my home
When I'm mobile

Hee, hoo!
beep beep!

Play the tape machine
Make the toast and tea
When I'm mobile
Well I can lay in bed
With only highway ahead
When I'm mobile
Keep me movin'

Keep me movin'
Over 50
Keep me groovin'
Just a hippie gypsy

Come on move now
Movin'
Keep me movin', yeah

Keep me movin', groovin', groovin', yeah
Movin', Yeah
Mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, ...

I don't care about pollution
I'm an air-conditioned gypsy
That's my solution
Watch the police and the tax man miss me
I'm mobile
Oooooh, yeah, hee!

Mobile, mobile, mobile yeah

Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to'prove'anymore

When I was'a little younger
I had to justify'my angst
I'd spend a lotta precious time
Tryna find the facts
Then one day, I met Mikael
Mikael don't like my whine
So now I don't look toward my death
I look toward my life

Somehow this girl changed me
From a sad man to a clown
Now they call me crazy
'Cause nothing gets me down

Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore

When me and my girl walk down the street
I don't stare people out
All the things I used to do like that
I do without
Everything with her makes sense
Everything is real
You don't need no evidence
When you're sayin' what you feel

Nothing, yeah
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore

Somehow this girl changed me
From a sad man to a clown
Now they call me crazy
'Cause nothing gets me down

Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore


You're alone above the street somewhere
Wondering how you'll ever count out there

You can walk, you can talk, you can fight
But inside you've got something to write
In your hand you hold your only friend
Never spend your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen

When you take up a pencil and sharpen it up
When you're kicking the fence and still nothing will budge
When the words are immobile until you sit down
Never feel they're worth keeping, they're not easily found
Then you know in some strange, unexplainable way
You must really have something
Jumping, thumping, fighting, hiding away
Important to say

When you sing through the verse and you end in a scream
And you swear and you curse 'cause the rhyming ain't clean
But it suddenly comes after years of delay
You pick up your guitar, you can suddenly play
When your fingers are bleeding and the knuckles are white
Then you can be sure, you can open the door
Get off of the floor tonight
You have something to write

When you want to complain, there's no one can stop you
But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you
You are wearing you heart on your jumping feet
You've got a head start away from the street

But is that what you want, to be rich and be gone?
Could be there's just one thing left in the end
Your guitar and your pen

When you sing to your mum, and you hum and you croon
And she says that she'd like it "with more of a tune"
And you smash your guitar at the end of the bed
Then you stick it together and start writing again
And you know that it won't be too long 'til your back
To bring her some money, she's calling you "honey"
Stashed in a bloody great sack
In your Cadillac

You're alone
You're alone

You're alone above the street somewhere
Wondering how you'll ever count out there

You can walk, you can talk, you can fight
But inside you've got something to write
In your hand you hold your only friend
Never spend your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen

Never spend your guitar or your pen


You were under the impression
That when you were walking forwards
You'd end up further onward
But things ain't quite that simple

You got altered information
You were told to not take chances
You missed out on new dances
Now you're losing all your dimples

My jacket's gonna be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker, with an open neck
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet

Love reign o'er me
Reign o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Love

I've had enough of living
I've had enough of dying
I've had enough of smiling
I've had enough of crying
I've taken all the high roads
I've squandered and I've saved
I've had enough of childhood
I've had enough of graves

I've had enough of living
I've had enough of dying
I've had enough of smiling
I've had enough of crying
I've taken all the high roads
I've squandered and I've saved
I've had enough of childhood
I've had enough of graves

Get a job and fight to keep it
Strike out to reach a mountain
Be so nice on the outside
But inside keep ambition

Don't cry because you hunt them
Hurt them first they'll love you
There's a millionaire above you
And you're under his suspicion

My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker, with an open neck
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet

Love reign o'er me
Reign o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Love

I've had enough of dance halls
I've had enough of pills
I've had enough of street fights
I've seen my share of kills
I'm finished with the fashions
And acting like I'm tough
I'm bored with hate and passion
I've had enough of trying to love


[Instrumental]


Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head on their furry donkey

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

I saw ya!


Johnny boy, he's always propping up the bar
He's sees life crystallized through his jar
He says he only lives for beer
But deep in his heart is a cry of fear

Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang onto

Sally seems to get bigger everyday
She evens out in a contented way
A finger on the pulse of every guy
But deep in the night you can hear her cry

Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a life that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
Oh please a heart to hang onto

Give me heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto, ooh yeah 

Give me a heart to hang onto, oo-ooh 

Danny, he wants to save for a new guitar
He's going to learn to play but he won't get far
He thinks it's an easy going' high
But his whole life is just another try

Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a suit that's tailored true
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang on...
Oo-oh yeah 
I need a heart... to hang onto...


Heat wave
Heat wave

Whenever I'm with you
Something inside
Starts to burn deep
And my heart's filled with fire
Could be that I'm very sentimental
Or is this just the way love's supposed to be?

I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart

Sometimes she calls my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't explain
I feel, yeah I feel
I feel this burning flame
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me
'Cause this is the way love's supposed to be

I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Just give me another chance
This could be a new romance

Heat wave
Heat wave
Heat wave
Heat wave


On top of the sky is a place where you go if you've done nothing wrong
If you've done nothing wrong
And down in the ground is a place where you go if you've been a bad boy
If you've been a bad boy

Why can't we have eternal life
And never die
Never die?
In the place up above you grow feather wings and you fly round and round
With a harp singing hymns

And down in the ground you grow horns and a tail and you carry a fork
And burn away

Why can't we have eternal life, and never die
Never die?


One, two, three, four!

What's for tea, Mum?
What's for tea, darling?
Darling, I said "what's for tea?"
What's for tea, daughter?

Heinz baked beans! (more music, more music, more music, more music)


When a man is running from his boss
Who holds a gun that fires cost
And people die from being old
Or left alone because they're cold
And bombs are dropped on fighting cats
And children's dreams are run with rats
If you complain you disappear
Just like the lesbians and queers

No one can love without the grace
Of some unseen and distant face
And you get beaten up by blacks
Who though they worked still got the sack
And when your soul tells you to hide
Your very right to die's denied
And in the battle on the streets
You fight computers and receipts
And when a man is trying to change
It only causes further pain
You realize that all along
Something in us going wrong

You stop dancing
Is it me, for a moment (for a moment, for a moment, for a moment)


Whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa),
I said whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa),
I love my baby (whoa, whoa, whoa),
Yeah, my baby love me (whoa, whoa, whoa),
And now when we get together (whoa, whoa, whoa),
Yeah, how happy we could be (whoa, whoa, whoa).
And I say all day (whoa, whoa, whoa),
Yeah, I said all night (whoa, whoa, whoa),
The reason well I'm so happy (whoa, whoa, whoa),
Yeah, my baby treated me right (whoa, whoa, whoa),

Yeah, I sayin' all night long (whoa, whoa, whoa),
Yeah, I said all night long (whoa, whoa, whoa).
Said all day (whoa, whoa, whoa),
Yeah, I said all night too (whoa, whoa, whoa),
And now when we get together, baby (whoa, whoa, whoa),
Yeah, no tellin' what we might do (whoa, whoa, whoa),
Yeah, I said all night long (whoa, whoa, whoa),
And I said all night long (whoa, whoa, whoa).
And now, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa),
And I say whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa).


You can pack up your bags and go looking,
For all things that need to be done,
Or you can spend all your life not thinking,
Never ending what you begun.

You take a step in the right direction,
But the man knocks us down on the floor,
And although he may think we are broken,
We'll get up and take two steps more.

It's your life to do what you want to,
By the way you push yourself out to the fore,
And whatever you think of the reason,
You bet your life you're here for more.

It's your life to do what you want to,
By the way you push yourself out to the fore,
And whatever you think of the reason,
You bet your life you're here for more.

You may think that you're pretty good people,
And you run at an even score,
But whatever you think you are here for,
You bet your life you're here for more.


Gazing down from Skidar, I can see the future
Music, art and science are gonna bust
Oh,'but'fair the bleeder'in this labyrinth
This ancient archive full'of dust

I'm a hero ground zero
If I don't take off, I'll surely drown
I'm a hero ground zero
In the end, every leader becomes a clown

Every rock star wants to make a movie
But the darkness she savours back to light
I won't go back to walk down music
From this old hilltop I'll take flight

I am a hero ground zero
In my face, a Klieg lamp burns my eyes
I'm a hero ground zero
On my back is the heat of a new sunrise

You look so good like spring
I didn't know that looks could kill
And a pay rock could hear you sing
How many rooms can one note fill?

You raise me up and then you drop me
I drank and sank absurd in stone
I was adopted by the angels
They said my future was postponed
I was a hero ground zero
I believe my stock has been thrown
I was a hero ground zero
I've had the shock of being dethroned
Of being disowned


Saw a man about fifty or so
Saw a man about fifty or so
He looked lonely but his eyes were bright
He looked lonely but his eyes were bright
He was walking up the Holland Park Road
He was walking up the Holland Park Road
And I stopped him to ask for a light
And I stopped him to ask for a light
He practically froze when I spoke
He practically froze when I spoke
But eased when he saw my cigarette
But eased when he saw my cigarette
Then I saw as he lit up my smoke
Then I saw as he lit up my smoke
Beneath his coat he was naked and wet
Beneath his coat he was naked and wet

With eyes full of shame
With eyes full of shame
For he knew that I knew
For he knew that I knew
He slumped to the wall with a moan
He slumped to the wall with a moan
I said "I know there's no name
I said "I know there's no name
For what you go through
For what you go through
But how can you do it alone"
But how can you do it alone"

I crossed the street to the local news store
I crossed the street to the local news store
Flicked through some cheap magazines
Flicked through some cheap magazines
Beside me some school kid I saw
Beside me some school kid I saw
Push some girlie mags down into his jeans
Push some girlie mags down into his jeans
The shop girl was watching amazed
The shop girl was watching amazed
Asked me to call for the police
Asked me to call for the police
She screamed at his blushing young face
She screamed at his blushing young face
And he escaped into the streets
And he escaped into the streets

With eyes full of shame etc.
With eyes full of shame etc.

Do it alone, how can you do it alone
Do it alone, how can you do it alone
I need your help, so I can do it by myself
I need your help, so I can do it by myself
Do it alone, don't have to breathe down a phone
Do it alone, don't have to breathe down a phone
I ain't got a clue, 'bout the things that you do
I ain't got a clue, 'bout the things that you do
But how ... can you do it alone
But how ... can you do it alone

How can you do it
How can you do it

Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower
Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower
And wasn't too keen on me sharing
And wasn't too keen on me sharing
She came out well after an hour
She came out well after an hour
And by that time I was past caring
And by that time I was past caring
Some women it seems have the knack
Some women it seems have the knack
Of attaining that stars in their dreams
Of attaining that stars in their dreams
They simply relax and lay back
They simply relax and lay back
While people like us scratch our jeans
While people like us scratch our jeans

With eyes full of shame
With eyes full of shame
And I know it must show
And I know it must show
I slump, and I fall and I groan
I slump, and I fall and I groan
Will somebody explain
Will somebody explain
What I need to know
What I need to know
How can you do it alone
How can you do it alone

How can you do it
How can you do it

How can you do it without any help
How can you do it without any help
How can you do it all by yourself
How can you do it all by yourself


I'm feelin' so good right now
There's a handsome boy tells me how I changed his past
He buys me a brandy
But could it be he's really just after my ass?

He likes the clothes I wear
He says he likes a man who's dressed in season
But no-one else ever stares, he's being so kind
What's the reason?

How many friends have I really got?
You can count 'em on one hand
How many friends have I really got?
How many friends have I really got?
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?

Suddenly it's the silver screen
And a face so beautiful that I have to cry out
Everybody hears me
But I look like a fool now
With a cry and I shy out
She knows all of my friends
But it's nice to find a woman who's keen on living
Now I think I've reached the end
I wonder in the dead of night - how do I rate?

How many friends have I really got?
How many friends have I really got?
How many friends have I really got?
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?

It's all like a dream you know
When you're still up early in the morning
And you all sit together to watch the 1 come through
But things don't look so good
When you could use a bit of warning
Then you know that no-one will ever speak the truth about you

How many friends have I really got?
How many friends have I really got?
How many friends have I really got?
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?

When I first signed a contract
It was more than a handshake then
I know it still is
But there's a plain fact
We talk so much shit behind each other's backs
I get the willies
People know nothing about their own soft gut
So how come they can sum us up
Without suffering all the hype we've known
How come they bum us up

How many friends have I really got?
You can count 'em on one hand
How many friends have I really got?
How many friends have I really got?
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?


I see myself on T.V., I'm a faker, a paper clown
It's clear to all my friends that I habitually lie; I just bring them down
I claim proneness to exaggeration
But the truth lies in my frustration
The children of the night, they all pass me by
Have to drench myself in brandy
In sleep I'll hide
But however much I booze
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out
I don't care what you say, boy
There ain't no way out

I lose so many nights of sleep worrying about my responsibilities
Are the problems that screw me up really down to him or me
My ego will just confuse me
Some day it's going to up and use me
Dish me out another tailor-made compliment
Tell me about some destiny I can't prevent
And however much I squirm
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out
I don't care what you say, boy
There ain't no way out

Won't somebody tell me how to get out of this place?!
Then the night comes down like a cell door closing
Suddenly I realize that I'm right now, I'm on the scene
While sitting here all alone with a bottle and my head a-floating
Far away from the phone and the conscience going on at me
And on at me, and I don't care what you say
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out

Now the walls are all clawed and scratched
Like by some soul insane
In the morning I humbly detach myself
I take no blame
I just can't face my failure
I'm nothing but a well fucked sailor
You at home can easily decide what's right
By glancing very briefly at the songs I write
But it don't help me that you know
This ain't no way out
Won't somebody tell me?
I don't care what you say, boy
There ain't no way out

There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out

Give me the key, lock it away
There ain't
There ain't
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out


Is it me, for a moment (for a moment, for a moment, for a moment)
Bell boy, bell boy
Love, reign o'er me
Can you see the real me, can you, can you?


I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way

Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say

That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you gotta stand trial
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze

Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles and miles

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles


Got a feeling inside (can't explain)
It's a certain kind (can't explain)
I feel hot and cold (can't explain)
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (can't explain)

I said (can't explain)
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (can't explain)
Yeah, hear what I'm saying, girl (can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling bad
The things you've said have got me real mad
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (can't explain)
Forgive me one more time, now (can't explain)

(Ooh) I said I can't explain, yeah
(Ooh) you drive me out of my mind
(Ooh) yeah, I'm the worrying kind, babe
(Ooh) I said I can't explain


I'm a million ages past you
A million years behind you, too
A thousand miles up in the air
A trillion times I've seen you there

Your hair is golden, mine is grey
You walk on grass, it turns to hay
Your blood is blue and your eyes are red
My body strains, but the nerves are dead

I can't reach you
I've strained my eyes
I can't reach you
I've split my sides
I can't reach, tryin' to get on you, see, feel or hear from you

The distances grow greater now
You drink champagne and past me plow
You fly your plane right over my head
You're so alive and I'm nearly dead

I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach, tryin' to get on you, see, feel or hear from you

Once I caught a glimpse
Of your unguarded, untouched heart
Our fingertips touched and then
My mind tore us apart

I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach, tryin' to get on you, see, feel or hear from you

I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach, tryin' to get on you, see, feel or hear from you


There's nothing in the way I walk that could tell you where I'm going,
There's nothing in the words I speak that can betray anything I'm knowing,
Don't think about the way I dress, you can fit me on a labelled shelf,
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,
Ooh I don't know myself.

I don't mind if you try once in a while,
I don't mind if I cry once in a while,
The doors aren't shut as tight as they might seem,
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.

Don't listen to the words I say, weighing up if I'm enlightened,
Don't shiver as you pass me by, 'cause mister I'm the one who's frightened,
The police just came and left, they wanted me and no one else,
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,
I said I don't know myself.

I don't mind if you try once in a while,
I don't mind if I cry once in a while,
The doors aren't shut as tight as they might seem,
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.

Do you remember me, I don't remember you,
Do you still love me, you know I think you do,
I have been gone, and some prison warder knows my scream,
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.

There's only five who know my real name,
And my mother don't believe they know it,
What she called me is the way I'm staying,
And no one'll ever know it,
Come on all of you big boys, come on all of you elves,
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,
I said I don't know myself.

I don't mind if you try once in a while,
And I don't mind if I cry once in a while.


I don't mind your love
I don't mind the one you're thinkin' of
I know, I know
You gonna miss me

I don't mind your love so sound
I don't mind, it can't go cold
I know, I know
You gonna miss me

I don't mind, it's the end of my song
I don't mind, good-bye, so long
I know, said, baby I know
You gonna miss me


He was drunk, I was blind
Though we tried to be kind
I was sunk, always late
We were quick to rotate

Let's be blunt, I was a bluff
And the surreal life was tough
I was a runt, we told lies
But to our great surprise

All the shit that we did
Brought us some money, I guess
And those snotty young kids
Were a standing success

Helped us conquer and rise
And we learned in this hell

We don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
Life teaches us well

We still pull, we get smug
And we all like a drug
Over full, always sated
Puffed up, elated

Let's admit our mistakes
Are what triggered our breaks
We were shits, oh, no disguise
And it is no surprise

That the crap that we did
Brought us money, God bless
And those snotty young kids
Were a standing success

Helped us conquer and rise
And we learned in this hell

We didn't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
Life teaches us well

Experiment, you universe
We'll ask why you choose to curse
Why set a fire you plan to douse?
Why set a rat to catch a mouse?

He was drunk (he was drunk), I was blind (he was blind)
Though we tried to be kind
I was sunk (he was sunk), he was late (always late)
We were quick to rotate

We tried hard to stay young
But the high notes were sung
We've been scarred, we've been prized
But you could see in our eyes

I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
We got wise

I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
We got wise
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
We got wise
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
We got wise


I like nightmares, I like being witless
Watch for the newsflash, cool eyewitness
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three it's happening
Gotta be a fucking fool to blame TV don't get trapped in
If you're lucky be the same as me
I like nightmares, yes I do 

There's a simple way to die they call it news
There's a simple way to die they call it booze
There's an easy, quiet escape just sleep and cruise
It's justifiable rape they say you choose 

And I like nightmares
I like feeling chickless
Flicking my lighter
Watching life flit west
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three...it's happening
Can we afford to strike three, don't trust the captain
He's just a boy like me
And I like nightmares...yes I do

There's a common way to weep they say just smoke
You can cry yourself to sleep they say just toke
There's a path that never fails you can't get lost
Don't need roads you're on rails I'll pay the cost 

And I like nightmares, yes I do
We were wasted, but you're only waylaid once
What we tasted was a voucher bag and lunch
We robbed their bank and we took their gold
And our lies in the tank must've sounded old
But we pleaded
I said, "Your honor, we're not chumps
After all, we only did it once!" 

We like nightmares
They test our fitness
A full can of goulash
A taint in the midwest
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three It's happening
Nothing floats interest free don't care what it's wrapped in
You could be abreast like me and I like nightmares
yes I do
I like nightmares 


Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you,
But they really mean "So long"

You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd

Please talk to me again
I need you

We're dancing
We will come and dance near you
We want to learn
Let us come and sitar with you

Distort my ears when
The music's loud
Yet you raise your hatchet
In the yellow crowd

Please talk to me again
I need you

Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you,
But they really mean "So long"

You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd

Please talk to me again
I need you


The time has come
For us to see if you'll take me once again
But darlin', I'll'be'back
I'll be reborn
I'know I will always want to'be your friend

This life was like climbing
So glad I put the time in
I've got so used to lovin' you
In this life, you so blessed me
Why would I want to get free?
I've been so happy lovin' you

I've lived too long, lost so much time
I must accept I might be finally dying, yeah
What will survive is my consciousness
It's what I guess
And when I'm alive again, you'll be my happiness
Yes, yes, yes

Next life, I will be climbing again
So glad I put the time in, and then
I'll remember how I once loved only you
In this life, you so blessed me
I would want that again, you see
To be happy again by lovin' you

I was young, rigged guitar
Afro hair and big car
No more "big star"
Just be happy and go hard
Not too far, not much now
Love your voice, it's time to go far
Because I'm watching you
Tonight is for viewing tunes
We had to ask for that
Get passion, ask for that
(False woman)
Security, head kick
Because I need you here, but you doubted me
Then I found my dignity with you

This life was like climbing
I'm so glad I put the time in
I got so used to lovin' you
In this life, you so blessed me
Why would I want to get free?
I've been so happy lovin' you

Do you believe in life after this?
What science decries as only a myth
We hang onto dreams like beacons from some ancient days
Then we get on and live out our life
Till we're looking right into the light
We only know for sure when we're lost in the haze

The time has come for us to see
If you'll take me once again
But darlin', I'll be back
I'll be reborn
And I know I will always want to be your friend
I always want to be your friend


One girl was called Jean Marie
Another little girl was called Felicity
Another little girl was Sally Joy
The other was me, and I'm a boy

My name is Bill, and I'm a head case
They practice making up on my face
Yeah, I feel lucky if I get trousers to wear
Spend evenings taking hairpins from my hair

I'm a boy, I'm a boy
But my ma won't admit it
I'm a boy, I'm a boy
But if I say I am, I get it

Put your frock on, Jean Marie
Plait your hair, Felicity
Paint your nails, little Sally Joy
Put this wig on, little boy

I'm a boy, I'm a boy
But my ma won't admit it
I'm a boy, I'm a boy
But if I say I am, I get it

I want to play cricket on the green
Ride my bike across the street
Cut myself and see my blood
I want to come home all covered in mud

I'm a boy, I'm a boy
But my ma won't admit it
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a boy
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a boy
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a boy


Now when I was a little boy 'bout the age of five
I had something in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive

Now I'm a man, I'm age twenty-one
You know baby, we can have a lotta fun
I'm a man, I spell, M A N
Man

All you pretty women, stand in line
I can make love to you baby, in an hour's time
I'm a man, spelled M A N
Man

I'm going back down to Kansas
To bring back the second cousin
Little John, the conqueroo
I'm a man, spelled M A N
Man

The line I shoot will never miss
The way I make love to 'em, they can't resist
I'm a man, I spell M A N
Man




I'm free
I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free
I'm free
An' I'm waiting for you to follow me

If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say 'nothing's that simple'
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

I'm free
I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality

I'm free
I'm free
An' I'm waiting for you to follow me

How can we follow?
How can we follow?


Every year is the same
And I feel it again
I'm a loser, no chance to win
Leaves start fallin'
Come down is callin' 
Loneliness starts sinking in

But I'm one
I am one
And I can see
That this is me
And I will be
You'll all see
I'm the one

Where do you get
Those blue, blue jeans
Faded, patched secret so tight?
Where do you get
That walk oh so lean?
Your shoes and your shirt's all just right

I'm one
I am one
And I can see
That this is me
And I will be 
You'll all see
I'm the one

I got a Gibson
Without a case
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face
Ill fitting clothes
And I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud

But I'm one
I am one
And I can see
That this is me
And I will be
You'll all see 
I'm the one

I'm the one

I'm the one


I'm the face baby, is that clear,
I'm the face baby, is that clear,
I'm the face if you want it,
I'm the face if you want it, dear,
All the others are third class tickets by me, baby, is that clear.

I'm the big wheel baby, won't you roll with me,
I'm the big wheel baby, won't you roll with me,
So many cats down the scene, honey,
????? hardly see.

Wear ivy league jackets, white buckskin shoes,
I wear ivy league jackets, white buckskin shoes,
So many tickets down the scene honey,
They're like to blow a fuse.

I'm the face baby, is that clear,
I'm the face baby, is that clear,
I'm the face if you want it,
I'm the face if you want it, dear,
All the others are third class tickets by me baby, is that clear.


I've been away so long
Wonder where I went wrong
Spent my last years in a cell
Never ever go away again
I've been so sad and lonely
Never ever ever gonna go away again
It's a waste of time doing time
When you dind't commit a crime
It wasn't me it was my brother Bill
And I'd have to tell never gonna speak to Bill again
He's made me sad and lonely
Never ever gonna speak to brother Bill again
It was no use, they put my brother on the jury
He bribed the others 'cause he owns the local brewery
They let me out today
Brother Bill's gonna pay
No one's ever gonna speak to Bill again
Never ever gonna speak to Bill again
He'll be too cold and bony
Never ever gonna go away again
Never ever gonna go away again
Never ever gonna go away again



You were under the impression
That when you were walking forwards
You'd end up further onward
But things ain't quite that simple

You got altered information
You were told to not take chances
You missed out on new dances
Now you're losing all your dimples

My jacket's gonna be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker, with an open neck
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet

Love reign o'er me
Reign o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Love

I've had enough of living
I've had enough of dying
I've had enough of smiling
I've had enough of crying
I've taken all the high roads
I've squandered and I've saved
I've had enough of childhood
I've had enough of graves

I've had enough of living
I've had enough of dying
I've had enough of smiling
I've had enough of crying
I've taken all the high roads
I've squandered and I've saved
I've had enough of childhood
I've had enough of graves

Get a job and fight to keep it
Strike out to reach a mountain
Be so nice on the outside
But inside keep ambition

Don't cry because you hunt them
Hurt them first they'll love you
There's a millionaire above you
And you're under his suspicion

My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker, with an open neck
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet

Love reign o'er me
Reign o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Love

I've had enough of dance halls
I've had enough of pills
I've had enough of street fights
I've seen my share of kills
I'm finished with the fashions
And acting like I'm tough
I'm bored with hate and passion
I've had enough of trying to love


I've known no war

And if I ever do I won't know for sure

Galbraith took his pen
Galbraith took his pen
To break down the men
To break down the men
Of the German army defeated
Of the German army defeated

By a soul that's been bought
By a soul that's been bought

In and out of reach loft
In and out of reach loft
The medals are lost

They belong to a lone broken sailor

His provinces now

Are the bars of the town

His songs and his poems of failure
His songs and his poems of failure
For his grandchildren can't see the glory
For his grandchildren can't see the glory
And his own kids are bored with the story
And his own kids are bored with the story
But for him they'd have burned behind netting
But for him they'd have burned behind netting
From the brink they were grabbed

Imagine a man
Not a child of any revolt
But a plain man tied up in life

Imagine the sand
Running out as he struts
Parading and fading, ignoring his wife

Imagine a road
So long looking backwards
You can't see where it really began

Imagine a load
So large and so smooth
That against it a man is an ant

Then you will see the end
You will see the end

Imagine events
That occur everyday
Like a shooting or raping or a simple act of deceit

Imagine a fence
Around you as high as prevention
Casting shadows, you can't see your feet

Imagine a girl
You long for and have
And the body of chalky perfection and truth

Imagine a past
Where you wish you had lived
Full of heroes and villains and fools

And you will see the end
You will see the end
And you will see the end
You will see the end
Oh yeah

Imagine a man
Not a child of any revolt
But a man of today feeling new

Imagine a soul
So old it it is broken
And you will know your invention is you

And you will see the end
You will see the end
You will see the end
You will see the end
Oh yeah


Ain't it funny how they're all Cleopatra
When you gaze into their past
When you find out about their birth signs
You realize there was no need to have asked

All the history of a soul in torment
Ingrained in a hand or a face
Ain't it funny how they all fire the pistol
At the wrong end of the race

I am going round and round
I am going round and round
I am going round and round
I am going round
Going round and round

There's a man going through your dust bin
Only this time he's looking for food
There's a tear in his eye, you don't know him
Oh but you know what he's going through

Ain't it funny that you can't seem to help him
Feelin' sick as he staggers away
Is it weird that you hate a stranger
Can a detail correct your dismay

I am going round and round
I am going round and round
I am going round and round
I am going round
Going round and round


If you're troubled and you can't relax
Close your eyes and think on this
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts
Close your eyes and think on this

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

If you ever want to lose some time
Just take off, there's no risk
If you ever want to disappear
Just take off and think of this

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

The sky is glass but the sea is brown
And everyone is upside down

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

Freak out!
Freak out!


In the ether
I hang suspended
I wait for you
And I know you're near
In this high heaven
My world's upended
I feel no passion
I feel no fear

I'm dizzy with love
But you never appear
In the gloom of this room
Of this cell down here

I know this place
Isn't truly real
And that like my love
It expands and sprays
The light will find me
Will bend toward me
Yet I'm marooned
In a billion days

I'm drunk with you
And I can't explain
Who or where I am
Or how I'm in pain

Rocking and rocking me
Rhythm is shocking me
Just like a child in your fist
You are knocking me
Rocking and rocking
Autistic, caged I am
Rocking and rocking
And rocking enraged

I am drunk with you
And I can't explain
Who or where I am
Or how I'm in pain

In the ether
In the ether

In the ether
I wait for you
Hanging in this mist
That I know's unreal
There is nothing there
There's no you, no me
Even though it's crazy
I still appeal

This is heavenly hell
I appear insane
I have no idea
Who there is to blame


Circles, my head is going round in circles
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool
Dragging me down

Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track
Dizziness will make my feet walk back
Walk right back to you

[Chorus]
Everything I do, I think of you
No matter how I try, I can't get by
These circles, leading me back to you

Round and around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around

And round and round like a fool I go
Down and down in the pool I go
Dragging me down

[Chorus]

There one thing could kill the pain of losing you
But it gets me so dizzy then I'm walking right back again
Back to you

Time will tell if these dreams are nearly fact
Don't know why I left, I'm coming back
Coming on back to you


I see a man without a problem
I see a country always starved
I hear the music of a heartbeat
I walk, and the people turn and laugh

Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is it in my head here at the start?
Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is it in my head, or in my heart?

I pick up phones and hear my history
I dream of all the calls I miss
I try to number those who love me
And find exactly what the trouble is

Is it in my head 
Is it in my head
Is it in my head here at the start?
Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is it in my head, or in my heart?

I feel I'm being followed
My head is empty
Yet every word I say turns out a sentence
Statements to a stranger
Just asking for directions
Turn from being help to being questions

I see a man without a problem


I see a man without a problem
I see a country always starved
I hear the music of a heartbeat
I walk, and the people turn and laugh

Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is it in my head here at the start?
Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is it in my head, or in my heart?

I pick up phones and hear my history
I dream of all the calls I miss
I try to number those who love me
And find exactly what the trouble is

Is it in my head 
Is it in my head
Is it in my head here at the start?
Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is it in my head, or in my heart?

I feel I'm being followed
My head is empty
Yet every word I say turns out a sentence
Statements to a stranger
Just asking for directions
Turn from being help to being questions

I see a man without a problem

It's not enough
Whatever you give

A little bit more
You always need
A little more man
A little more seed

It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It's never enough

I gave you cash
I gave you love
All that I heard
Was "It's Not Enough"

I work so hard
It gets so tough
Whatever I give
Never feels like enough
It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It's never enough

When I'm on my knees
I keep taking your stuff
Make sure that you know
It's never enough

You said you'd go as far
As to turn to my friend
Who once warned me of you
Said you'd hasten my end
Because I have lent
Every ounce of my juice
My essence is spent

You'll always want
A little more pink
I'll always need
A little more ink

It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It's never enough

However I praise
However I puff
Though you may smile
It won't be enough

Right at the end
When I start to bluff
An' the lift's going down
An' I start acting tough

It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It's never enough

I'll find someone else
To finish filling me up
I'll smile and admit
You were never quite enough

Like Brigitte Bardot
In Godard's Les Mepris
I can't love you enough
To make you complete
You appear in my dreams
With some new courtier
You need me there to see
What you need to convey

It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It'll never be enough

No hysterical scene
You will never play rough
I'm the one who will scream
But it won't be enough

It's never enough
It's never enough

It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It'll never be enough

I'll never hold you
How can I scold you?

It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It'll never be enough


It's not true

You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life

[Chorus]
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there

I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese either
And I didn't kill my dad

[Chorus]

If you hear more rumors
You can just forget them too
Fools start the rumors
None of them are true

[Chorus]

You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life

I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese either
And I didn't kill my dad

[Chorus: x2]


Up here on the ledge
Up here on the ledge
I'm getting pushed to the edge
I'm getting pushed to the edge
People line up behind me to step into my shoes,
People line up behind me to step into my shoes,
Up here in the precipice
Up here in the precipice
I'm getting close to my nemesis
I'm getting close to my nemesis
People fighting each other to jump into my blues
People fighting each other to jump into my blues

There's a young kid inside me somewhere
There's a young kid inside me somewhere
He stays up all night, a vampire that never dies,
He stays up all night, a vampire that never dies,
With the blood and the moon in his eyes
With the blood and the moon in his eyes
I hear his voice when I'm comin' down,
I hear his voice when I'm comin' down,
Sleep is for fools, whe never see the sunrise,
Sleep is for fools, whe never see the sunrise,
Who never get to live twice.
Who never get to live twice.

I was a face in a magazine,
I was a face in a magazine,
When you were still playin' with your plasticine,
When you were still playin' with your plasticine,
Now you're doggin' my tail, ridin' the slipstream,
Now you're doggin' my tail, ridin' the slipstream,
You can take the fans and the enemies
You can take the fans and the enemies
The little girls who squeeze and tease
The little girls who squeeze and tease
Then pass on their social disease,
Then pass on their social disease,
Go get your penicillin.
Go get your penicillin.

I know you young and dumb,
I know you young and dumb,
I know where you're comin' from.
I know where you're comin' from.
Don't know where you're goin' to,
Don't know where you're goin' to,
But I bin there same as you,
But I bin there same as you,
You're running out of ideas,
You're running out of ideas,
And new hats to try on.
And new hats to try on.
I know you middle age
I know you middle age
Same song, different page,
Same song, different page,
I know what you're goin' through
I know what you're goin' through
Made the same mistakes as you,
Made the same mistakes as you,
All you want is some hope
All you want is some hope
And a shoulder to cry on.
And a shoulder to cry on.

There's a stranger inside me somewhere
There's a stranger inside me somewhere
That shadow behind me, don't even look like me.
That shadow behind me, don't even look like me.
An echoed apology.
An echoed apology.
He's a wolf in sheep disguise,
He's a wolf in sheep disguise,
I wake up in places I don't even recognize,
I wake up in places I don't even recognize,
Pretender in paradise.
Pretender in paradise.

It's your turn, step up and take it
It's your turn, step up and take it
If you've got the guts to hang on
If you've got the guts to hang on
You can make.
You can make.
C'mon, c'mon, come on,
C'mon, c'mon, come on,
Ooooh take it!
Ooooh take it!

Everywhere they've been you have been

Or you might be there now if you own a Jag already

The radio blasting, the girls are glancing
The dash is dancing with gleaming dials

When you hear this sound a-comin'
Hear the drummer drumming
Won't you join together with the band
We don't move in any 'ticular direction
And we don't make no collections
Won't you join together with the band

Do you really think I care
What you eat or what you wear
Won't you join together with the band
There's a million ways to laugh
Ev'ry one's a path
Come on and join together with the band

Everybody join together
Won't you join together
Come on and join together with the band
We need to join together
Come on join together
Come on and join together with the band

You don't have to play
You can follow or lead the way
Oh won't you join together with the band
We don't know where we're going
But the season's right for knowing
Oh won't you join together with the band

It's the singer not the song
That makes the music move along
Oh won't you join together with the band
This is the biggest band you'll find
It's as deep as it is wide
Come on and join together with the band

Join together
(Ev'rybody come on) join together 
Join together with the band
Join together
(Ev'rybody come on) join together 
Join together with the band


(He's a joker, he's a joker, he's a joker)
Joker James, you did it again, caused somebody pain
(He's a joker, he's a joker)
You lived up to your name, Jimmy, he's Joker James.

Sally was a stamp collector, pretty little girl
One day she dated James, bringing love into her world
A tense romantic moment as they sat down on the couch
The whoopee cushion roared and I'm afraid it's over now.

(He's a joker, he's a joker, he's a joker)
Joker James, you did it again, caused somebody pain
(He's a joker, he's a joker)
You lived up to your name, didn't you, he's Joker James.

Lucy was a cool one, always got her high
Then she dated James and true love took her higher
The jester had suggested a new way to get stoned
Put itching powder down her neck and now she's all alone.

(He's a joker, he's a joker, he's a joker)
Joker James, you did it again, caused somebody pain
(He's a joker, he's a joker)
You lived up to your name, didn't you, he's Joker James.

Sense of humor cannot woo her
Her skin felt like heaven and laughter all the while
Her sense of humor throws him and deep in love he falls
But when he tries to sign the paper, the rubber pencil falls.

(He's a joker, he's a joker, he's a joker)
Joker James, you're not to blame, the joke's on you, now you're blue
(He's a joker, he's a joker)
It's such a shame, but that's the game, he's Joker James

(He's a joker, he's a joker, he's a joker)
Joker James, you did it again, caused somebody pain
(He's a joker, he's a joker)
You lived up to your name, Jimmy, he's Joker James

The BBC present, Keith Moon played by himself, the postman by John Mail, and a sweet, crumbly disc jockey, Johnny Merengue, in "Life With The Moons".

Wah, well darling, here we are! At home, safe and sound at last.

Ah ah ah ah ah... achoo!

I won't say I don't enjoy 'em -- 'cause I DO -- but why does it always teem down with rain whenever we play an open air festival?

Achoo!

Mind you, I'll give 'em credit, it was well-organized, the stage was very well covered. Pity the artist wife tent blew away in the storm, though.

Achoo!

Still, it was lucky for us we saw Viv Stanshall. He coulda laid there for weeks! Jolly decent of him to mat read (???) for us on the way back though, wasn't it?

Achoo!

You know, girl, all this travelin' about made me think: why don't I do a rock opera based on pilgrim's progress, eh? I could play the part of Charles ??? meself, Daltrey could help me with the hard bits... I did call Leanne at Radio One about it, but they said he was incommunicado. Bleedin' funny time to go on your holidays.

Achoo!

Blimey, I'm stuffy in here! Here, let's get some air in... Ah, ooh, that's much better. Whoa, what's wet clothes when you can breathe God's good air?

Achoo!

Still, let's have a bit of music, eh?


And now, once again, it's time for an everyday story of country-folk.

The BBC present "Life With The Moons", with Keith Moon played by himself, a revolutionary violinist played by Fidel Castro, and a well-known groupie taking the part of well, just about anybody.

Hello sweetheart, I'm home!

(burp)

Hang on, I'll just take me coat off... uh! That's taken the weight off me mind!


See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

Little Billy was the fattest kid in his class
Always the last in line
All the other little kids would laugh at him
Said he'd die before his time

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy didn't mind

Most of the kids smoked cigarettes
Just to prove that they were cool
The teacher didn't know about the children's games
And Billy always followed the rules

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy didn't mind

Billy was big on the outside
But there's an even bigger man inside
Ten million cigarettes burning every day
And Billy's still doing fine

Now Billy and his classmates are middle-aged
With children of their own
Their smoking games are reality now
And cancer's seed is sown

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy's didn't mind

Most of them smoke maybe forty a day
A habit Billy doesn't share
One by one they're passing away
Leaving orphans to Billy's care

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy doesn't mind

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy's doing fine


Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
Bingo and rock were pushing out x-rating
We were the first band to vomit at the bar
And find the distance to the stage too far
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

Long live rock! I need it every night
Long live rock! Come on and join the line
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive

People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

Long live rock! I need it every night
Long live rock! Come on and join the line
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive

Landslide, rocks are falling, falling down upon our very heads
We tried but you were yawning, look again
Rock is dead
Rock is dead
Rock is dead

The place is really jumping to the high watt amps
'Til a twenty inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps
In the blackout they danced right into the aisle
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock

Long live rock! I need it every night
Long live rock! Come on and join the line
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive


Layin' on my back
In the newly mown grass
Rain is coming down
But I know the clouds will pass
You bring me tea
Say "the babe's a-sleepin'"
Lay down beside me
Love ain't for keeping

Black ash from the foundry
Hangs like a hood
But the air is perfumed
By the burning firewood
The seeds are bursting
The spring is a-seeping
Lay down my darling
Love ain't for keeping
Lay down beside me
Love ain't for keeping

Lay down beside me
Love ain't for keeping
Lay down my darling
Love ain't for keeping


Surrounded by people
A real heavy crowd
But inside I still feel lonely now

Should I get away
From the high heels so proud
Is there something different life can show me now

First chance - I blew it, I better start it all again
Second chance - Ooh, I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said
Third chance - I'm cut up, life's like a razor's edge
Fourth chance - Ooh, I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge

And I'm goin' down (I'm goin' down)
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)
Ooh, down

I'm not a loser
But did I really win?
Can I afford to go through it all again?

I hope I don't sound 
As immature as I feel
But when I get wise, I'll give you a call, my friend

First chance - I blew it, I better start it all again
Second chance - Ooh, I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said
Third chance - I'm cut up, life's like a razor's edge
Fourth chance - I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge

Now I'm goin' down (I'm goin' down)
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)
Ooh, down (down)

Love is coming down on me, ooh yeah
Love is burning, teaching, turning out in me
Love is coming down, down
Down, down
Down, down

I'm not a loser
But did I really win?
I'm lookin' forward to doin' it all again


Only love
Can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love
Can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers
Laying in the fields

Love reign o'er me
Love reign o'er me, rain on me, rain on me

Only love
Can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love
Can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high

Love reign o'er me, rain on me, rain on me
Love reign o'er me, rain on me, rain on me

On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spend apart alone
I need to get back home to cool, cool rain
I can't sleep and I lay and I think
The night is hot and black as ink
Oh God, I need a drink of cool, cool rain

Love reign o'er me, rain over me, over me, over me, oh
Love reign o'er me, whoa, on me

Love

She wants a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
He buys her things she calls him honey
She calls me poor boy
What good could it do
To give a love pure and true
When any fool could understand
She thinks that money makes the man

She wants a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
She wants the things she'll buy with money
Not a poor boy
A man with money, man with money, man with money

Just down the street
I know a place
When there asleep
I'll cover my face
I'll break the lock, open the door
I'll slip inside, I'll rob the store

Then I'll be a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
I'll buy her things, she'll call me honey
Not a poor boy
A man with money, man with money, man with money, man with money




I danced with Linda
I danced with Jean
I danced with Cindy
Then I suddenly see

Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her, man, those shaky hands

Mary is so pretty
The prettiest in the land
Guys come from every city
Just to shake her shaky hands

Linda can cook
Jean reads books
Cindy can sew
But I'd rather know

Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her, man, those shaky hands

Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her, man, those shaky hands

Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her, man, those shaky hands

Plenty of drums!
Plenty of drums!
Plenty of drums!
Plenty of drums!
Plenty of drums!
Plenty of drums!
Plenty of drums!


Henry Pond had no fun
Had a face like a currant bun
This adolescent little fella
Was nicknamed by his friends "Old Yella"

The doctors gave him creams and lotions
To try to sooth the boy's emotions
But all in vain, the acne stayed
Henry's hopes began to fade

Then, when just about to crack
Found another cream, Medac

When Henry in the mirror peered
His pimples all had disappeared
Henry laughed and yelled "I got 'em!
Me face is like a baby's bottom!"


My coffee's cold, my paper's old
My heart is sold to melancholia
My clothes are torn, my shoes are worn
My heart is born to melancholia

A strange surprise, what I despised in other guys is here in me
They lose their girl, they lose their world
Then they cry for all to see
I've never felt so bad
The fires drive me mad

The sheets are gray, left since the day she went away, I lost all power
The dust is thick, the dog is sick, the kids have picked most of the flowers

The sun is shining, but not for me
The sun is shining, but not for me
I've never felt so bad
The fires drive me mad

The sheets are gray, left since the day she went away, I lost all power
The dog is sick, the dust is thick, the kids have picked
Most of the flowers

We're not strong enough!
We're not young enough!
We're not long enough,
Not cold enough
Emotionally we're not even old enough!

Late at night, we're in a video-game dream,
There is no lover in this numbered scene
We summon every childhood ghost we've seen,
Then suddenly we hear that Mike Post Theme,

(Chorus)
Everything is alright (ba-do-ba)
We pray today (ba-ba-ba-do-ba)
Everything is OK (ba-do-ba)
We play today

Late at night, on the underground train,
Through endless suburbs in endless pain,
Then deep in the tunnel under the London rain,
Suddenly we hear Mike Post Again,

(Chorus)

We watch those films,
That make men cry,
Young lovers kiss,
Then fight, and die,
We start to yearn, we climb the vine,
We have to face the truth sometime.

We're not strong enough!
We're not young enough!
We're not long enough,
Not cold enough
Emotionally we're not even old enough!

Well late at night we found our racing team,
We're faced with women and reality games,
We feel alive,
We feel new and blind,
We're hearing Mike Post in the air this time

(Chorus)

We watch those films,
That make men cry,
Young lovers kiss,
Then fight, and die,
We start to yearn, we climb the vine,
We have to face the truth sometime

If you don't hear me, how can I tell you
If you don't listen, why should I speak
If you're indifferent, how can I reach you
Just 'cos you're angry don't assume I'm weak

Howling Wolf, and old Link Wray
Dave Van Ronk and Doris Day
Bobby Darin, Brownie McGhee
Elvis, Buddy and Eddie C.

Music makes me, makes me strong
Strong vibrations, make me long
Long for a place where I belong
You will find me in this song.

Who will walk through the mirror door
Will there be music, or will there be war
Will we be rich, or will we be poor
Who will walk through the mirror door

Who will walk through the mirror door
Will there be music, or will there be war
Will we be rich, or will we be poor
Who will walk through the mirror door

Fire and fear in a suicide eye

Rolling thunder under New York sky

Touch me, feel me...
Who am I? Where did I come from?
Have you known me? Have you seen me?
Mother?

NORA:
You're a hero, you are famous.
You're a champion of the young.
You are rich, but it's so absurd to try
To explain all the things you've done.
You're adored and you're loved.
Thousands watch you play
Pinball! It's a fever,
And you're the master of the game.
And now that you're whole
You'll be champion of the very soul

TOMMY:
Yes, I'm healed:
Delivered from silent darkness.
No more locked doors,
Or stifled screams!
Pinball?
What I see now before me,
Is far beyond a game,
Beyond your wildest dreams!

Those who love me have a higher path to follow now.
And you, dear Mother, too, must be prepared!

Much too much to bear
Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If its you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your loves too heavy on me
And its much too much to bear
If I ever leave you darlin'
I hope you see
That I really love you
But your loves too heavy on me
And its much too much to bear
When I make love to you
Do all the things you want me to do
You never think of me
Always cry a bevy
Bevy of tears
'Cause your loves too heavy on me
And its much too much to bear
There was a time I could give all I had to you
But my enthusiasm waned and I can't bear the pain
Of doing what I don't want to do
Much too much to bear
Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If its you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your loves too heavy on me
And its much too much to bear


Deep in the back of my mind is an unrealized sound
Every feeling I get from the street says it soon could be found
When I hear the cold lies of the pusher, I know it exists
It's confirmed in the eyes of the kids, emphasized with their fists

But the high has to rise from the low
Like volcanoes explode through the snow
The mosquito's sting brings a dream
But the poison's derange

The music must change
For we're chewing a bone
We soared like the sparrow hawk flied
Then we dropped like a stone
Like the tide and the waves
Growing slowly in range
Crushing mountains as old as the Earth
So the music must change

Sometimes at night, I wake up and my body's like ice
The sound of the running wild stallion, the noise of the mice
And I wondered if then I could hear into all of your dreams
I realize now it was really the sound of your screams

But death always leads into life
But the street fighter swallows the knife
Am I so crazy to feel that it's here prearranged?

The music must change
It's gets higher and higher
Smoldering like leaves in the 1
Then it bursts into fire
Its rhythm grows strong
It's so new and so strange
Like bells in the clouds, then again
The music must change

But is this song so different?
Am I doing it all again?
It may have been done before
But then music's an open door

Deep in the back of my is an unrealized sound
Every feeling I get from the street says it soon could be found
When I hear the cold lies of the pusher, I know it exists
It's confirmed in the eyes of the kids, emphasized with their fists

But the high has to rise from the low
Like volcanoes explode through the snow
The mosquito's sting brings a dream
But the poison's derange

The music must change
For we're chewing a bone
We soared like the sparrow hawk flied
Then we dropped like a stone
Like the tide and the waves
Growing slowly in range
Crushing mountains as old as the Earth
So the music must change

Well, come on, pretty baby, let's go out tonight
Your mom won't have to worry, everything'll be alright
Don't let me hear you talking, just be there when I call
'Cause what I do, I do my way or it won't be done at all

Little girl, can you hear what I say?
I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way

Yeah, I was born a tiger, always had my way
Don't ever try to change me this or any other day
Don't let me hear you argue the things I say I do
Don't give me no trouble or you all and I are through

Little girl, can you hear what I say?
Yeah, I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way

Well, come on, pretty baby, let's go out tonight

You better believe it, baby


My life's
In jeopardy
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be
I haven't been home since Friday night and now my wife
Is comin' after me

Give me police protection
Gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one
Give me a bodyguard
A black belt judo expert
With a machine gun!

Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane!
When she catches up with me,
Won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough
To send her half-insane!

Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots, and take a long, long drive
I may end up spendin' all my money,
But I'll still be alive!

All I did was have a bit too much to drink
And I picked the wrong precinct
Got picked up by the law and now I ain't got time to think

Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane!
When she catches up with me,
Won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough
To send her half-insane!

Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots, and take a long, long drive
I may end up spendin' all my money,
But I'll still be alive!

And I'm oh, so tired of running
Gonna lay down on the floor
I gotta rest some time
So I can get to run some more
Yeah!

She's comin'!
She's comin'!
She's comin'!
She's comin'!
She's comin'!
She's comin'!
She's comin'!
She's comin'!
She's comin'!
She's comin'!


Take a little dope
And walk out in the air
The stars are all connected
To the brain
Find me a woman and lay down on the ground
Her pleasure comes fallin' down like rain
Get myself a car
I feel power as I fly
Whoa, now I'm really in control

It all looks fine
To the naked eye!
But it don't really happen that way at all!
Don't happen that way at all!

You sign your own name
And I'll sign mine
They're both the same
We still get separate rooms
You can cover up your guts
But when you cover up your nuts
You're admittin' that there must be something wrong
Press any button
Milk and honey flow
The world begins behind your neighbor's wall

It all looks fine
To the naked eye!
But it don't really happen that way at all!
Don't happen that way at all!

You hold the gun
And I hold the wound
And we stand lookin' in each other's eyes

It all looks fine
To the naked eye!
But it don't really happen that way at all!
Don't happen that way at all!


You need a new song
I'll set the words up so they tear right at your soul
Don't take me too long
But there's a danger that I'll plagiarize something old

My fingers kill me as I play my guitar
'Cause I've been chewing down at my nails
My hairline ain't exactly superstar
But there's one thing that never fails
This never fails

I write the same old song with a few new lines
And everybody wants to cheer it
I write the same old song you heard a good few times
Admit you really want to hear it

Whenever I see you
You always treat me like I'm some kind of perfect man
Just 'cause I please you
You explain, but you don't think I can understand

My head is spinning as I scrawl with my pen
'Cause I've been pouring vodka in my soul
Nothing really ever changes my friend
New lamps for old
New lamps for old

We sing the same old song, just like a vintage car
You can look but you won't ever drive it
We drink the same old wine from a brand new jar
We get hung over, but we always survive it

Turn on the radio
Love is proclaimed
Again and again and again
Join in and sing
Now, don't be ashamed
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain

We hum the same old lines to a different crowd
And everybody wants to cheer it
We run on endless time to reach a higher cloud
But we never ever seem to get near it

We sing the same old song


When you look through the lights to the stage
You see the man of your dreams
You think his life's full of parties and love
But it's not what it seems
If you could see in his room right now
You'd see how much love is showed
There's never really any romance on the road

His forehead seems cut in two
By the crease in his brown
He chews his nails and he fidgets
Just tryin' to settle on down
The TV channels keep flippin'
His adrenaline slowed
There's never really any romance on the road, oh no

There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He could fall in love but he'd never know
For she's only riding and he's only hiding
He's sure to ask but she won't say,"No"
But there's never really any romance on the road

He was up in the bar straight-backed
Did you see him before?
Did he sign you his name?
Come with me, listenin' at his door
Hear himself so drunk calling home
Can't remember the code
You know, there's never really any romance on the road
Oh no, no, no

He's held some beautiful girls in his arms
But now he clutches his bunk
For all the good that they're doing him now
He might as well be a monk
For his memories ain't worth a thing
Till he's old and he's gone
And his past never quite catches up
The show's movin' on

Did he say he kept a picture
Of a blonde haired girl who'd been kind?
When he was last home, his own daughter
Brought it into his mind
Maybe closing bars and jets
Paid some debts that he owed
But there's never really any romance on the road

There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He's never learned a thing from the dust that blowed
On stage for an hour, on a laser beam tower
But you know he slept while the neon glowed
There's never really any romance on the road

There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He could fall in love but he'd never know
For she's only riding and he's only hiding
He's sure to ask but she won't say, "No"
There's never really any romance on the road




I've got a spade and a pick-axe
And a hundred miles square of land to churn about
My old horse is weary but sincerely
I believe that he can pull a plough
Well I've moved into the jungle of the agriculture rumble,
To grow my own food
And I'll dig and plough and scrape the weeds
Till I succeed in seeing cabbage growing through

Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming
How calming and balming the effect of the air

Well, I farmed for a year and grew a crop of corn
That stretched as far as the eye can see
That's a whole lot of cornflakes,
Near enough to feed New York till 1973
Cultivation is my station and the nation
Buys my corn from me immediately
And holding sixty thousand bucks, I watch as dumper trucks
Tip New York's corn flakes in the sea

Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming
How calming and balming the effect of the air

Now look here son
The right thing to say
Isn't necessarily what you want to say
The right thing to do
Isn't necessarily what you want to do
The right things to grow
Ain't necessarily what you want to grow
Your own happiness
Doesn't necessarily teach you what you want to know

Well I'm suntanned and deep, so's the horse
And my hands are deeply grained
Old horse is a-grazing, it's amazing
Just how lazily he took the strain
Well my pick and spade are rusty,
Because I'm paid on trust to leave my square of cornfield bare

It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming
How calming and balming the effect of the air

When you grow what I grow
Tomatoes, potatoes, stew, eggplants...
Potatoes, tomatoes...gourds


She sang the best she'd ever sang
She couldn't ever sing any better
But Mister Davidson never rang
She knew he would forget her

She'd seen him there
And put herself to ransom
He had stared
He really was quite handsome

She had really looked her best
She couldn't ever look any better
But she knew she'd failed the test
She knew he would forget her

Triumphant was the way she felt
As she acknowledged the applause
Triumphant was the way she'd felt
When she saw him at the dressing room door

She was happier than she'd ever been
As he praised her for her grace
But his expression changed, she had seen
As he leant to kiss her face

It ended there
He claimed a late appointment
She quickly turned
To hide her disappointment

She ripped her glittering gown
Couldn't face another show, no
Her deodorant had let her down
She should have used Odorono

It's smooth sailing with the highly successful sound
Of wonderful Radio London!


Old red wine, well past its prime,
May have to finish it, after crossing the line.
Dusty old wine, two thousand a time,
An inch of black mud always left behind.
They say you turned in while the sun still shined,
That gorgeous girl with you was highly primed.
She said she'd take you way down or way up,
She might break your heart, she might crack you up.
Old red wine, not worth a dime,
Gonna have to drink it with you some other time.
Expensive old wine, forty years lying,
Mice chewed the labels, don't know what we're buying.
Back home in California, they got wine for the meek,
There's a Bowl and a Fillmore, the Cow and the Greek.
You sniffed at the cork, chose low on the list,
As you dashed to the lights and gazed through the mist.
Old red wine, well past its prime,
Gonna have to drink it with you some other time.
Just let it breathe,
Oh, let it breathe,
Breathe life, breathe life.
Let it breathe,
Oh, let it breathe,
Let it breathe.


One at a time
One at a time
Always ready to fight over the little things
Always ready to fight over the little things
One at a time, she's

Always ready to fight over the little things.

She's going crazy and the table starts shaking,

She's been abusing her body again

Her vision gets hazy and the bottles start breaking

She's been seeing that man again.
She's been seeing that man again.

She insists, she so innocent.

So I stayed out at another late meeting

And she waited up for another argument.

I'm moving on to something better,
I'm moving on to something better,
There must be something better than this,
There must be something better than this,
She's got me so confused
She's got me so confused
As to who's being used

Call her up right away

You've got her number

And I promise not to pick up the phone
And I promise not to pick up the phone
You can pick her up in your clapped out Humber

I just hope it can get you home

There's a scene
There's a scene
Indelible, it hangs before my eyes
Indelible, it hangs before my eyes
In our teens, incredibly
In our teens, incredibly
Together with no ties
Together with no ties

That was a life enough for me
That was a life enough for me
One life's enough for me
One life's enough for me

Throw back your head
Throw back your head
Let your body curve
Let your body curve
Into the long grass of the bed
Into the long grass of the bed
Pull me down into your hair
Pull me down into your hair

And I'll push and swerve
And I'll push and swerve
As we both gasp in the evening air
As we both gasp in the evening air
Yeah
Yeah

Throw back your head
Throw back your head
Let your body curve
Let your body curve
Into the long grass of the bed
Into the long grass of the bed
Pull me down into your hair
Pull me down into your hair
And I'll push and swerve
And I'll push and swerve
As we both gasp in the evening air
As we both gasp in the evening air


Our love was
Our love was famine, frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
Then suddenly

Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning

Flying, soaring
Shining morning
Never leaving
Lying, dying

Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long

Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long

Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long

Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning

Our love was famine, frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
And then suddenly

Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning


Out!

Out in the street
I'm talkin' 'bout slowly
I'm not gonna rest
Woman, you don't know me

Yeah, you don't know me, no
Know me, no
Know me, no
Yeah, but I'm a-gonna know you

Hey listen, woman
You just can't throw me
I won't stand it
If you don't know me

If you don't know me, no
Know me, no
Know me, no
Yeah, but I'm a-gonna know you

Listen to me
I'm telling you
You look at me, woman
Yeah, tell the truth

I know your mind
I can see that you're in need
I'll show you woman
Yeah, that you belong to me

You're gonna know me, no
Know me, no
Know me, no
Yeah, I'm a-gonna know you

Give me no reasons
Said you'd go free
It's not gonna be now
If you gotta know me

You're gonna know me now
Know me now
Know me now
Yeah, you're gonna know me


Captain Walker didn't come home
His unborn child will never know him
Believe him missing with a number of men
Don't expect to see him again


I'll tell ya fuckin' somethin'! Alright, now listen! Just fuckin' listen and shut up! Right. Now either sit down, or stand up, or lay down, or do somethin', but shut up! Right. This is a fucking rock and roll concert, not a fucking tea party! Right!


Now I'm in the ether
Look down at time
I see three children
Prepare to walk the line

I see them older
When life is done
I was a loser
At the game they won

Come on let's try
To pick up the peace
You and I
On our hands and knees
Come on let's try
To touch the Fleece
Come on let's try
To pick up the peace

(How do old people forget
That the wars we've seen
Are 'bout me longing for you
You longing for me?)


I used to wake up in the morning
I used to feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad

He said, son now here's some little something
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
In fact I, I don't feel bad at all
I don't feel so bad at all

Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems
Pictures of Lily helped me feel alright

Pictures of Lily
Lily, oh Lily
Lily, oh Lily
Pictures of Lily

And then one day things weren't quite so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said, son, now don't be silly

She's been dead since 1929
Oh, how I cried that night
If only I'd been born in Lily's time
It would have been alright

Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night

For me and Lily are together in my dreams
And I ask you, hey mister, have you ever seen
Pictures of Lily?


Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean
He plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist
A pinball wizard's
Got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets a replay
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was
The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball


Please, please, please, please me (You don't have to go)
Baby please, baby please, please me (You don't have to go)
Baby please, baby please don't go (You don't have to go)
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby 
I love you so (You don't have to go)

Baby, you know you broke my heart when you went away (You don't have to go)
I said, I said, I said I'll see you some other day (You don't have to go)
I said, baby, baby, please, don't go (You don't have to go)
Don't go, no baby, no baby
I love you so (You don't have to go)

Take this pain from my heart

Baby, let me take you by the hand (You don't have to go)
Baby, baby let me, let me be your lover man (You don't have to go)
Baby please, baby please don't go (You don't have to go)
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby 
I love you so (You don't have to go)

Please, please, please, please me (You don't have to go)
Baby please, baby please, please me (You don't have to go)
Baby please, baby please don't go (You don't have to go)
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby 
I love you so (You don't have to go)

Please please me

[Chorus:]
We're having a lovely time, wish you were here
We're having a lovely time, wish you were here
There's miles of frankfurters and people who hurt us in Germany
We haven't played since yesterday
There's just ten more shows and one week to go
We'd all like to go

[Chorus]

Great piles of spaghetti, bad vibes like confetti in Italy
We go by train and not by plane
We'd come home by car if it wasn't too far
To drive home by car
Hope you're well at home,
Next week I'll try to phone,
Not very long to go,
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know

[Chorus]

There's lots of French fries, disapproving eyes in the U.S.A.
We've had no shows since I don't know
There's just one thing wrong, we've been here too long
The money's all gone

[Chorus]

There's kangaroos and we're bad news in Australia
Thrown off the plane for drinking beer
So long on the plane it drove us insane
So long on the plane
Hope you're well at home,
Next week I'll try to phone
Not very long to go
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know

[Chorus]

We've done very well, but we've been to hell and heaven as well


[Instrumental]


There once was a note, pure and easy,
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by
The note is eternal, I hear it, it sees me,
Forever we blend it, forever we die

I listened and I heard music in a word,
And words when you played your guitar,
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,
And a child flew past me riding in a star

As people assemble,
Civilization is trying to find a new way to die,
But killing is really merely scene changer,
All men are bored with other men's lies

I listened and I heard music in a word,
And words when you played your guitar,
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,
And a child flew past me riding in a star

Gas on the hillside, oil in the teacup,
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy,
Distortion becomes somehow pure in it's wildness,
The note that began all can also destroy

We all know success when we all find our own dreams,
And our love is enough to knock down any walls,
And the future's been seen as men try to realize,
The simple secret of the note in us all, in us all

I listened and I heard music in a word,
And words when you played your guitar,
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,
And a child flew past me riding in a star

There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen 
There once was a note, listen


I got lost in the back streets, trying to get here tonight,
The police were asking questions, they took me to the wrong place twice.
I even lost my passport, and I forgot my name and town,
But now I'm here by the water, put the money down.

Before I walk on the water,
Put the money down, down, down,
There are bands killing chickens,
My hero's getting pushed around, 'round, 'round.

I don't know if I trust you as you try to shoot me down,
Before I walk on the water,
Put the money down, down, down,
Put the money down.

It was a beautiful day in Columbus when the fences fell
But the five loaves and the fishes ain't going to be much help,
I got a hungry juggler here who wants to be at the head,
Before he walks the water he wants his bread.

Take a glass of that light brown ale and a purple pill,
If the air don't get you too sure as hell the pill will,
Oh, mommy, mommy, please may I go downtown?

He's gonna walk on the water,
Put the money down,
Put it down, before I walk on the water,
Put the money down, down, down.

There are bands killing chickens,
My hero's getting pushed around, round, round,

I don't know if I trust you as you try to shoot me down,
I'm gonna walk on the water,
Put the money down, down, down, down, down,
Put the money down.
In a tin cup.


[Instrumental]
