Tell me was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low
Sunk this low
So who's left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost
Now we're gone, left without a trace
But we took something they cannot replace

A match made in heaven, paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

You chew up peace and spit it out as war
You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door
You are rotten to the core
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger
If you're looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror
You knew all along, that the cancer would spread
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Sorry son, but we destroyed your home
We murdered your family, now you're on your own
Collateral damage, face down in the sand
Watch the dominoes fall, it's all just part of the plan

A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
And every execution, the price of your collusion
You knew all along, that the cancer would spread
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Tell me was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low
Sunk this low

You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core


""We are both silenced And we're sure this does not add up Still we try and place our bets We're sure this does not add up Still we're dying To make that call Our people versus yours Never did make sense Your people versus mine Light me up it's all too much for me Never did make sense come dance with me We'll go out the sea the sky was blood read Images of people dead Stained with the shadows Of our past victims we're out at sea Then come and drown with me We'll float away drift away Our corpses lifeless Then somehow tell me we made sense""


The workers all march to the beat of the drum.
Their spirits are broken, they have nowhere to run.
They dream of courage and a loaded gun,
But the slaves all know, they better bite their tongue.
Track marks across the planet.
Are there any veins left for them to infect?
They would kill one another just to disconnect.

Three cheers for desperation. 
God bless the Godforsaken.
We will arm them to the teeth, 
To fight, to fight the war on peace.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin.

The workers all march to the beat of the drum.
They fell into the trap, taken one by one.
The medicine is poison, but it makes them numb.
'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret.
Existence is just something they would rather forget.

Three cheers for desperation. 
God bless the Godforsaken.
We will arm them to the teeth, 
To fight, to fight the war on peace.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin.

Is this freedom? Is this the life you chose?
If this is living the dream, we've hit an all-time low.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin.


""Son of god Hangman's pawn. Control our lives With fairytales and shallow lies. You say we'll burn in hell. Spiteful preacher I know you well. Desperation breathes and follows you home Look around you're not alone. One life and one chance the world in front of me. Intelligent design sending shivers down my spine.

""If only you were here to hold my head above bloody waters We could make it through You turned your back on me and now I do the same to you You made me feel so hollow How can the man that you looked up to turn around and say three words that hurt more than you'll ever know You don't know what it feels like to be in my shoes You turned your back on me as I stood there and fell to the floor This time there's no reason for me to turn around and scream for help But if only you were here to hold my head above all those things you said to tie me down I'm looking for forgiveness for something that I didn't even do How can you call yourself and idol a person to trust? How can I look so high up when you're always holding me down?""


Always the one with a face on
Always the one with never enough
He was the boy that broke your trust
Because he was never around enough
We sit around and hear these stories
Wishing we were somewhere else
How I wish that I could find the words to save this

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again

I was the one with the face on
I was the one with never enough
I was the boy that broke your trust
Because I was never around enough
I sit around and tell these stories
Wishing I was somewhere else
Oh how I wish I found the words to save this

My so called friend
My so called friend

I wish I found the words to save this
I'm pushing it out, out
Find the words to save this
I'm pushing it out, out, out

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again
When will we see you again


Do you feel at home in limbo?
Hiding a broken vow
A phantom at the window

Can you swallow the shame?
Has your courage been burnt out, faded away?
There won't be a saviour in sight, but it's okay
('Cause we're comfortable)

We're stood at the edge of the world
Seize the snakes (the snakes)
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world

When the clock runs down to zero
We'll stand up and take a bow
So quick to play the hero

Are you fanning the flames?
Are you torching the lighthouse?
Stood in the way
Complicity burning so bright, yet we delay
(Are you culpable?)

Seize the snakes (the snakes)
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world
Drag the lake (the lake)
When the water runs dry, we'll be slaves to the anchor
The Devil may cry
We're stood at the edge of the world

We're stood at the edge of the world

Nothing is holy
We all take the blame
Crumbling slowly
The cliff face belongs to the ocean
So run for your life

Do you remember the tip of the spear?
The edge of the knife?
We're freshly dismembered
But won't shed a tear
So run for your life

We're stood at the edge of the world
Seize the snakes (the snakes)
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world

Drag the lake (the lake)
When the water runs dry, we'll be slaves to the anchor
The Devil may cry
We're fighting to stay alive
How can we all survive?
No second chances
We're stood at the edge of the world

We're stood at the edge of the world, yeah
We're fighting to stay alive


I do my best but everything seems ominous.
Not feeling blessed, quite the opposite.
This shouldn't feel so monotonous.
It never rains but it pours.

We're just a bunch of fucking animals,
But we're afraid of the outcome.
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in says I should pull the pin.

Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?

I dug my heels, I thought that I could stop the rot.
The ground gave way, now I've lost the plot.
Fucked it again that was all I've got.
It never rains but it pours.

Life is just a dream within a...

We're just a bunch of fucking animals,
But we're afraid of the outcome.
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in says I should pull the pin.

Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud.
Infinity is waiting there cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral.

Dream within a, dream within a...

We're just a bunch of fucking animals,
But we're afraid of the outcome.
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in says I should pull the pin.
We're just a bunch of fucking animals,
But we're afraid of the outcome.
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in says I should pull the pin.

Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?
(Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud.)
Should I just pull the pin?
(Infinity is waiting there cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral.)
Should I just pull the pin?


Sowing the seeds.
Roots dig deep, whilst we sleep.
Snakes in veins, valves decay.
All of the meaningless words we say.

Cast the first stone, from behind the throne.
Crown of thorns, now overgrown.
All our wants and needs, bring us to our knees.
Can't turn back now the seeds are sown.

Seven billion, one of a kind.
Collide together, intertwined.
National lines used to define,
where we draw the enemy lines.

Weapons aren't used in this war.
Wait for the fallout from this absence of thought.
All the things we can't afford to ignore.
The sun doesn't shine anymore.


""We've found a taste for self destruction A blind eye for blatant dysfunction We've found a taste for self destruction We're all born in black blood  There's an imminence stirring like a siren singing There's a debt to pay but they keep on drilling Why is simple truth so hard to tell We had Eden and turned it into hell Born in black blood  Because this distance in our minds Is the distance that we're behind I can't forgive we won't forget I can't forgive we won't forget  The lonely sound of the final drip Like the starting gun marking the end of it On the shoulders of forever it's a long way to fall Black gold will be the death the death of us all Black drought the word will spread Of the time we found what the earth bled Born in black blood  Because this distance in our minds Is the distance that we're behind I can't forgive we won't forget I can't forgive we won't forget Because this distance in our minds Is the distance that we're behind I can't forgive we won't forget I can't forgive we won't forget We won't forget We won't forget  Black drought word will spread Of the time we found what the earth bled We found the cancer inside of our heads There's no turning back now we're as good as dead When the well dried up No one cared But when hell shows up They'll all stop and stare When the well dried up No one cared But when hell shows up They'll all stop and stare  We found the cancer inside of our heads No turning back now we're as good as dead We've found the cancer inside of our heads No turning back now we're as good as dead I can't forgive we won't forget I can't forgive we won't forget I can't forgive we won't forget I can't forgive we won't forget We won't forget""


Do you cross your heart when you hope to die?
Are you sleeping deep in the hurricane?
IVs in the arm, forgetting to feel
We're crawling on all fours
Will you fall on that sword at the second coming?
You're gonna taste the ash and dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms

Now the wheels are turning
What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?

You wanna make your hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah)
Sure sounds like heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Give us a Judas steer we can deify
Yeah, we all pretend we're the renegades
So wash us away, garroted by a halo
Take a bow, 'cause time's running out
There's no doubt that the end is coming
You're gonna taste the ash, you're gonna taste the dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms

Now the wheels are turning
What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?

You wanna make your hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah)
Sure sounds like heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Post-love, post-truth, justice lays bound
And black bagged ready for the guillotine
We can all plead guilty when they ask
"Where were you when the Gods clipped the wings of the Phoenix?"
They cut the wings off the Phoenix, ah
When will we wrestle the world from the fools and their gold and their fucking covenant?
(We'll be waiting)
Will enough be enough when we're holding on for dear life

You wanna make your hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah)
Sure sounds like heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint
It's enough to plague a saint
It's enough to plague a saint
It's enough to plague a saint

Ah, we can all plead guilty when they ask
"Where were you when the Gods clipped the wings of the Phoenix?"


Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags

You said "see lookit, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another
Even in their plastic little covers"

And I said I know it well

That secret that you knew
But don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good, girl
'Cause its running you with red

Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar

You said "ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this"
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

And I said I know it well

That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

And I said I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well

""I'm looking back on a time when I could say I actually thought I cared about you But after everything I've been put though I realise that I've been living with false hope It's drowning out my senses It's drowning out my thoughts This has got oh so confusing And I've only got myself to blame I can't believe... oh what was I thinking I've only got my self to blame You mean nothing to me And you never fucking did I can't stand to listen to your excuses anymore I can only pray that you feel so alone A guilty conscience hangs over your head I can't believe... oh what was I thinking I've only got myself to blame But maybe I'm the only one to blame in all of this I've got nothing to depend on anymore""


""Falling into stringencies I never thought that I would be here Dependence on the evenings I'm out of touch  It's too late to hide what you kept hid What explains with words were crooks I'm falling out I'm falling out Of touch with myself  I felt like this since forever This is killing me I felt like this since forever This is killing me  What escaped Was what I dreamt then blurry eyes said the stories I'm broke apart fading hours empty dreams Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends I wore the same routines over every fucking night I'm beginning to lose faith in friendships I  I felt like this since forever This is killing me I felt like this since forever This is killing me  Lift me up from this never ending fear of myself Dependence on the evenings to get me through Show me the line I can't just walk away  How much longer can I break the same routines? Blurry eyes broken clocks fading hours How much longer can I break the same routines? Blurry eyes broken clocks fading hours  Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends""


God only knows why we were born to burn 

If God is my witness, He'll see that all is not well  
Christ, what a sight for sore eyes 
Looking down on us, all the children that You despise  

God only knows why we were born to burn
God only knows why we were born to burn

A bullet in the neck doesn't feel much like love  
A message of rejection sent from above 
No flags, no holy books 
I'll be in hell with the misunderstood 

The sons and daughters that you wished to forget  
A desperate picture of God's regret  
Are we perfect mistakes? 
Or almighty fuck ups? 
One thing's for sure, He doesn't fucking love us  
He doesn't fucking love us

Hate must weigh on you like a broken cross 
Hate; the dividing line we'll never step across  

Outcast and reject  
Outcast and reject

Father, Father, how I've let you down 
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown
Father, father, how I've let you down 
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown

The sons and daughters that you wished to forget 
A desperate picture of God's regret 
Are we perfect mistakes? 
Or almighty fuck ups?  
One thing's for sure, He doesn't fucking love us  
He doesn't fucking love us
He doesn't fucking love us


It's run down
The back of my head
The back of my mind
About a hundred thousand times
And I can't
Seem to shake it
Seem to shake it
Addiction's tying me down

Pull me under
I can't take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before
You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before
I've been through this patch before

I'm lost and alone in my head
And I can't make sense of myself
I need to find a simple away
To make this pain just disappear
I know I'll never feel
Safe in my own skin

Pull me under
I can't take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before

No matter how long I'm gone for
It's at the back of my mind
Another sleepless night
Somebody get me home

I'm so far down
And there's anyone can say to me
I'm so down, I'm so down

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before


""You!  Send my regards to you and yours I'm not coming back for you  And I'll hold onto the last memory of you I'll hold onto you and bury you at sea How can you watch me split in two? You've done this before you know me oh too well  Send my regards to you and yours And no hope will come from this So turn around and run How can you smile when you see me crumbling?  And we all stood back and watched the waves crash down on you Send my regards to you and yours And there's no hope for someone as cold as you You made me sink into the coldest of waves And I watched you sink into lies that you created I watched you sink into lies that you created""


Oh!

No one knows permanence quite like you
There's a ruthlessness in all that you do
This is not about what we deserve
There's no bias in the misery served

C.A.N.C.E.R!

So watch the sun sink into the sea
There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me!

When we all fade away
And this world can't bare another day
There will be no fight in broken bliss

Respected will we be at the end of this

Urgh!

I feel it now more than ever
A reaper's watch
My life ready to sever!

Your name carries more than disease
A symbol of man brought to his knees
This is not about what we deserve
There's no bias in the misery served

C.A.N.C.E.R!

(When we all fade away)
(And this world can't bare another day)
(There will be no fight in broken bliss)

Find a little light and hold it close
Don't lose sight, don't lose sight of what matters most!

This is a burden we all carry together
Waiting in the wings, so we never say never!

When we all fade away,
And this world can't bare another day
There will be no fight in broken bliss.

Respected will we be at the end of this

So watch the sun sink into the sea
There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me!

C.A.N.C.E.R!
C.A.N.C.E.R!

This is a burden we all carry together!
Waiting in the wings, so we never say never!!!


This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.
This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.

I've made promises that I know I can't keep.
Drink from the holy grail, you'll find it's bittersweet.
No matter what he says, poison is not my friend.
But he'll have my back until the bitter end.

Always climbing but only ever descending.
The canvas before me is never-ending.

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods.
If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good.
I said "enough is enough".
Well I guess I lied, I guess I lied.

This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.
This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.

All my mistakes will outlive me.
I just can't accept that what will be, will be.
My lungs are failing, I can't catch my breath.
I don't know why, but right now I'm scared to death.

My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.

Always climbing but only ever descending.
The canvas before me is never-ending.

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods.
If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good.
I said "enough is enough".
Well I guess I lied, I guess I lied.

I wasted time building castles in the air.
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there.
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.

This is the path I chose. This is the path I chose.

I wasted time building castles in the air.
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there.
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.


Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
We brought the battle, we saw the signs,
We've found ourselves two steps behind.

I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.
(pray for drought)

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. 
This is colony collapse.

Give us the rope and we'll tie our own noose.
We truly believed all we touched turned to gold.
We were warned but we wouldn't be told.

I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. 
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. This is colony collapse.
Colony collapse.

Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.

They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. 
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true.

The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

This is colony collapse.


""In the bigger picture I've been painted out Cracks in the earth blacken the sea No canvas is reserved for me Look up close and try to see In every stroke lies past alone  Too close to home cutting too close to bone The ink has dried and words reveal Too close to home cutting too close to the bone It's too easy to admit defeat  Time flys flys flys as you lay your bones to rest Flys flys as your past decays inside your chest  You aren't a child fighting in a war Son please don't tell me that this is bored Tear your things out from the earth Long departed we're so short-sighted  Too close to home cutting too close to bone The ink has dried and words reveal Too close to home cutting too close to the bone It's too easy to admit defeat  My tongue has sung around the world But it's heard in all the power of words It cannot be it cannot count So now it's a sadistic power in me My tongue has sung around the world But it's heard in all the power of words So hell turned and birthed all means We're all the earth's disease  Too close to home cutting too close to bone The ink has dried and words reveal Too close to home cutting too close to the bone It's too easy to admit defeat""


It could take a second
To tear down years of work
And we won't get these days
Back again (back again)

I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me

And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted

Someone, tell me how I've ended up here
With nobody watching over me?

We need to bring back the days we used to love
Before all the color drains away

I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me

To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those (sing it loud)

Where did they go?
The days we used to know
Where did they go?
Have I forgotten what it feels like?
Where did they go, where did they go
The days we used to know
Where did they go, where did they go

Have I forgotten what it feels like?

And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted


Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
The Wind was taken us in the wring direction
It's about time we show some disaffection
Carry the weight of thousands of years
Turn the page
Lets make it all disappear
We've had enough of inhibited progression
Held back by cloack and dagger oppression

we're insulting our own intelligence
I won't listen without any evidence
I'll live my life in the name of no one
Bow your head 
Palm to palm
Worship here in this celebral cathedral
As day breaks,
The sunlight heals,
As day breaks,
The light reveals

Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking

It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn relieve the friction

Blue hours quicken the pulse
Upon the upper edge, reality dawns
Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn relieve the friction
Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn relieve the friction


I wanna bother God
I wanna feel the ground beneath my feet
But I've got a smile full of broken teeth

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

I know it's not enough
Why does defeat always taste so bittersweet?
I just wanna live and die in peace

The flower that never blossoms is quickly forgotten
It must be gold if it's glistening
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself
Fly high cause the ravens are here to stay
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of

Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butter'
Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies

The flower that never blossoms is quickly forgotten
It must be gold if it's glistening
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of
Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies
Fly high cause the ravens are here to stay
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of
Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies


These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of God's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes

You've got to watch your back
You've got to swallow fear
Cover your tracks, or you might disappear
They found the words to speak unspeakable things
And they struck the air from the chests of kings

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of God's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes

If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
Would you run and hide, or stand for what you believe?
Maybe Orwell was right all along
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of God's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget
Swear that you won't forget

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget
Swear that you won't forget

Tell the rats to get back in the gutter
We'll be watching, we're always watching

You try to stamp them out, you'll only fan the flames
This is for all the snakes. Fuck you
So hold your forked tongue
You've got us spitting nails
I'm gonna to say it straight. Fuck you

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget
If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun


""I've watched you from a distance but never spoken a word I have seen every flaw you tried to hide from the world I sit silent in shadows watching the paths you have made If only you knew my intentions I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over This is not healthy I need to some how stop this But your beauty intrigues me It seems to be pulling me in All I want is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over I only you knew my name and all of my motives Yet I sit in the same place every night and wait for you to come back home A few moments would help me find myself But this problem has taken its tragic grip Just a few moments will help me find myself again If only you knew my name and all of my motives I need to somehow stop this All I need is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity Something I can hold close to me""


There was a time for change,
I fear it came and went.
Who's gonna pick up the pieces?
Who will be left to repent?
The sun is burnt out black.
Now there's no turning back.
Now there's no turning back.

Yeah I know you know that we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn.
We just wanna watch the world burn, blegh!

Our collapse will be remission.
A planet scarred beyond all recognition.
Suicide in slow motion, is this the path that we've chosen?
Too cowardly to face this, we've got a fucking deathwish!
You want to play with fire? Don't cry when you get burnt.
You gave us life, we gave back death in return.
The sun is burnt out black.
Now there's no turning back.

We will consume until there's nothing left.
Remember us as a waste of breath.

Yeah I know you know that we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn.
We just wanna watch the world burn.

I know you know that we've been living a lie.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
We just wanna watch the world burn.

I want to believe that it all counts for something.
The writing is on the wall.
It's hard to accept that it was all for nothing.
All for nothing.

Yeah I know you know that we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn.
We just wanna watch the world burn.


We are the misguided youth
They've backed us into a corner
All our lives we've been infected
They should have never had a chance

Because they're forcing us
To believe
In a world that we shouldn't trust
Delete, rewind and try to change this
State of mind

Give us something to believe in
Give us something to make our own
Give us something to believe in
Give us something to make our own

When will we stand up
And choose our paths

This is the end of the world
At least that's what we're told
This is the end of the world
Board up the windows
And lock your doors

Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

This is getting old

We are the misguided youth
We sat back and lost our voices

Delete, rewind and try to change this
State of mind
Delete, rewind and try to change this
State of mind

Because they're forcing us
To believe
In a world that we shouldn't trust
Delete, rewind and try to change this
State of mind
And hopefully you knew it all
You knew it all along

Delete, rewind
Delete, rewind

When will we stand up 
We've been through enough
When will we stand up
Have we let them take the best of us


I think I'm missing a piece of the puzzle
I could drown when I'm just stood in a puddle
A jet black reservoir sits beneath these scars
It's all I've ever known

Please applaud it's good to know who's below me
I keep on preaching but I'm so phony holy
I've been stuck on repeat
But I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

It feels like a glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone

Yeah, it's all that I've ever known
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

I see the smoke but I don't move a muscle
Pretend I'm broken so you don't burst my bubble
I look up at the stars but don't see so far
It's all I've ever known

Can you spare me all of the ceremony?
Let's not pretend because I don't even know me
I've been dead on my feet
But I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

It feels like a glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone

Yeah, it's all that I've ever known
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

This is d'j' vu
But I'm a Demi-God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi-God
I always feel so blue
But I'm a Demi-God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi God

This is d'j' vu
But I'm a Demi-God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi-God
I always feel so blue
But I'm a Demi-God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi-God

Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
It's all that I've ever known
Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

A glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone


""Another cold dark night left alone Your arrogance will lead to the death of you I'll be the one to pull your head back down Remove your hollow Crown So far from the truth you hide away I'll be the one to pull your head back down Remove your hollow crown I'll die happy knowing that I will never be anything like you What gives you the right to silence me? All my life I've wanted just to fell like this You came you conquered you gave it away And how does it feel staring down on your idol's grave The one you once looked up to has fallen into dust The one you once looked up to has fallen away What's left for you in this fickle world? Remove your crown""


""This is your country this is your home Here is the house where you grew up alone This is your country this is your home Here is the house where you grew up alone  The city streets you used to love Are bruised and broken are black and blue On our TV's miles away On our doorsteps with no reason why  Take it back take it back take it back Take it back take it back take it back  This is your country this is your home Here is the house where you grew up alone Remember this remember this for what it was Remember this remember this for what it was Remember this remember this  Take it back take it back take it back You want a voice but your voices sound like violence You don't you don't deserve this life You don't you don't deserve this  This is your country this is your home Here is the house where you grew up alone Remember this remember this for what it was  A bleak projection of absent minds You want a voice but your voices sound like violence You shout so loud but all I hear is silence The city streets that you show no love Are bruised and broken because of you Because of you Because of you  This is your country this is your home Here is the house where you grew up alone This is your country this is your home Here is the house where you grew up alone Remember this remember this for what it was Remember this remember this for what it was For what it was""


Oh, it just won't calculate
A prophecy with a twist
Do you really think Christ was a capitalist?
Every man for himself
Let thy neighbour drown
Amen

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep (so sing us to sleep)
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues
Now discourse is dead

Stood at the tip of the wing
Gotta watch where you tread

Round up the ambivalent
You mustn't sit in the shade
'Cause it's blasphemous
For one to abstain from hate
We're all sisters and brothers
But if you're one of the others
Then fuck you

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep (so sing us to sleep)
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

So save me the sermon
You all sound the same (you all sound the same)
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

No common sense left in these empty heads
Swimming towards the storm
Two beating hearts
Two poles apart

Whoa, whoa

No common sense left in these empty heads
Swimming towards the storm
Two beating hearts
Two poles apart

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

So save me the sermon
You all sound the same (you all sound the same)
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues
Now discourse is dead

Stood at the tip of the wing
Gotta watch where you tread
Don't look down
Let thy neighbour drown
Discourse is dead


No tree can grow to heaven
'Til its roots reach down to hell
Will we ever learn our lesson?
We all fall in parallel

No tree can grow to heaven
'Til its roots reach down to hell
Will we ever learn our lesson?
We all fall in parallel

Don't bury the confession
There's a light behind the shell
Do you dream of Armageddon
Just to get yourself to heaven?

We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel


Remember when Hell had frozen over?
The cold still burns underneath my skin
The water is rising all around me
And there is nothing left I can give
All these tears I've shed
I saw the wildfire spread
You said you cheated death
But Heaven was in my head

They say "the good die young"
No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday

The embers still glow when I'm sober
The gold in the flame burns brighter now
I have to rebuild, now it's over
Maybe now I'm lost, I can live
Souls don't break, they bend
But I sometimes forget
I have to do this for you
And the only way out is through
Yeah, death is an open door

Words the prophets said
Still swimming through my head
Now there's no stars left in the sky
'Cause this well will never run dry
What if I completely forget?
What if I never accept?
'Cause when you fade away
It's like a brand new doomsday
Yeah

They say "the good die young"
No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday


They want all for one and none for all,
I want to be there to witness the downfall.

They'll only sell us out once our backs are turned,
And we'll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt.
So cast your votes,
Watch them shed their skin.
Every snake has its price.
If the money's on the table they don't think twice.
So cast your votes, 
Watch them shed their skin.

We are paralysed.

But there are none so blind as those who will not see.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck;
About what matters to us.

Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette.
They'll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt.
So cast your votes, 
Watch them shed their skin.
Always out for blood, praying on the weak.
We can count on them to paint the future bleak.
But we're still standing by whilst they bleed us dry.

We are paralysed.

But there are none so blind as those who will not see.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck;
About what matters to us.
So enough is enough.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck.

Right and wrong it's all the same to me.
Thick as thieves as far as I can see.
They are leeches all (They are leeches all).

Right and wrong it's all the same to me.
Thick as thieves as far as I can see (I can see).
They are leeches all but we're still standing by whilst they bleed us dry.

They want all for one and none for all,
I want to be there to witness the downfall.

We are paralysed.

They want all for one and none for all,
I want to be there to witness the downfall.


From the cradle to the grave
Destined to break like the waves
Existence is so threatening

It takes a fierce grace to crack us open
A moment sat with our sentencing
And the light comes flooding in
Oh, the light comes flooding in
When the leaves fall in the spring

May all the beggars be blessed
Like angels with anhedonia
We're all just doing our best
Repeating, "There's nothing left"
That's why we weed out the wonderers
Maybe there's virtue in emptiness
But I still drown in distress
When the leaves fall in the spring

With the ravens here to stay
And the doves all flying away
Sedation feels so welcoming

In the subtle space, there's an endless ocean
But the devils sing and it's deafening
What a world we're living in
Oh, we're never listening
When the leaves fall in the spring

May all the beggars be blessed
Like angels with anhedonia
We're all just doing our best
Repeating, "There's nothing left"
That's why we weed out the wonderers
Maybe there's virtue in emptiness
But I still drown in distress
When the leaves fall in the spring

I've got a lot to lose
But I won't lie to you
And make believe sincerity
I'm praying for a remedy

Beloved distant blue
One day I'll die for you
And swim in sweet serenity
'Cause death is not my enemy

I've got a lot to lose
But I won't lie to you
And make believe sincerity
I'm praying for a remedy

Beloved distant blue
One day I'll die for you
And swim in sweet serenity
'Cause death is not my enemy


I've been out for so long, days slipped by again
And I can't sleep since I stopped caring
I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
And I can't tell daylight from streetlights anymore
As he cast his shadow

I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't look back
I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't, I'm not looking back

This is so unfamiliar; death is no man's friend
Yet I'll stay here until I hear him roar

Death is screaming my name but I refuse to listen to him

I can't sit here forever
Watch me rise again
Watch me rise back up
Forever would be just be so easy to fall into
But still I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
Forever is the easy option but I won't take it

The choices I've made will lead me to an early fucking grave

There's a rose that blooms
Through the cracks in the concrete
Staining the prison floor
There's a pilgrimage waiting
Sat at the doorstep
Rotting beneath the sun

When there's nowhere left to hide, we'll be searching for a shortcut
Ire and denial are as thick as thieves
Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me
Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe
Tell me how to coexist when a fraction only wants war
Hopelessly in love with our gritted teeth
Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me
Don't forget to breathe, I forgot to breathe
And look who's on the throne now

I'm a dead heretic
With no storm left to weather
Afraid to admit
It won't sustain the spirit
A new counterfeit
Like flight without feathers
Ready to submit
It won't sustain the spirit

It won't sustain the spirit

So we fall to our knees
And beg for reprieve
But it's almost time for the curtain call
The apostles will sing
And lead us from sin
But they hold all of our bones in their hands

We all swim against the tide until it puts us on the back foot
Nothing's ever tasted half as good as grief
Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me
Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe
'Cause I'm staring at a fist and it's asking if I want more
Clarity will visit but it's only brief
Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me
Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe

I'm a dead heretic
With no storm left to weather
Afraid to admit
It won't sustain the spirit
A new counterfeit
Like flight without feathers
Ready to submit
It won't sustain the spirit

It won't sustain the spirit
It won't sustain the spirit
It won't sustain the spirit
It won't sustain the spirit

There is no endgame.
So whisper the truth and pass on the blame.
Just put us out of our misery.
This defeat is a victory.
We're burning out, we're fading away.
A failed evolution.
Is the problem, the solution,
That they've been searching for?

We're waiting for the world to save itself.
'Cause nothing is built to last.
We're writing our epitaph.
So reset and start again.
'Cause we all know how this ends,
Before long we'll be dead and gone.

A thorn in the side of the Earth,
Where do you draw the line?
A flaw in the design.
The rest is history.
This defeat is a victory.
We're burning out, we're fading away.

"We live in an infinite growth paradigm. Nothing grows forever, it's not possible. As a great, uh psychologist James Hillman wrote: "The only thing that grows in the human body after a certain age is Cancer." and I think that that's clearly what we're seeing at the end of human industrial civilization with the population approaching seven billion."

We're all guilty as sin.
I feel it, I feel it under my skin.
Always up in arms, 
Without lifting a finger, lifting a finger.

OH!

We may be infinite but this world is not.
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot, that we long forgot.

We're waiting for the world to save itself.
'Cause nothing is built to last.
We're writing our epitaph.
So reset and start again.
'Cause we all know how this ends.
Before long we'll be dead and gone.

We're all guilty as sin.
I feel it, I feel it under my skin.
Always up in arms, 
Without lifting a finger, lifting a finger.

We may be infinite but this world is not something that we once knew that we long forgot.


The Gospel, distorted
It leaves my blood running cold
But still they say
I'm rigging the ritual

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

It's so convoluted
They're just trepanning for gold
May they rest in peace
'Cause they're fucking dead to me

Well there's your eulogy
The water's polluted
My feathers caught in the spill
Nobody said that it would be safe up here

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

Your salvation's a letdown
Ooh-ooh
Oh, I'm sorry that I'd rather feel
I'd rather feel alive

It leaves a mark on the mind
It weaves a web in the background
Silently
No time to spare
No sign of the exit wound
God help me
There's no drying off
Once you're soaked right down to the bone
Hopefully
Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath
Woe is me

It leaves a mark on the mind
It weaves a web in the background
Silently
No time to spare
No sign of the exit wound
God help me
There's no drying off
Once you're soaked right down to the bone
Hopefully
Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath
Woe is me

Woe is me
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

Your salvation's a letdown
Ooh-ooh
Oh, I'm sorry that I'd rather feel
I'd rather feel alive


Don't say we're better off dead
Soon we could be in remission
I said "It's not enough"
They told me "It'll be fine,
Happiness isn't a crime son,
So pick your guts from the floor"

We'll all be hanging a hero
Praying for someone to save us
Goliath says I oughta let it go

Nobody's proving me wrong
They're all singing hallelujah
Keep two eyes open
Cause jackals live by the candlelight

We've got a mountain to climb
But I ain't got the permission
They wanna call my bluff
They said "You're crossing the line"
I said "It takes one to know one"

Oh, please God be merciful
Cause they know not what they do

We should be begging for more

We'll all be hanging a hero
Praying for someone to save us
Goliath says I oughta let it go

Nobody's proving me wrong
They're all singing hallelujah
Keep two eyes open
Cause jackals live by the candlelight

Bury your head in the sand
Soon you'll be feeling the fangs
So sleep with two eyes open
Cause jackals live by the candlelight

Long live the king that's not listening
No time for rats in the gutter
Snakes coiling but we're signaling
Screaming at one another

Long live the king that's not listening
No time for rats in the gutter
Snakes coiling but we're signaling
Screaming at one another

Smoke em out and set a fire in the hive
They wouldn't break their stride if we were burning alive
Burning alive

Cause jackals live by the candlelight
They live by the candlelight

Nobody's proving me wrong
They're all singing hallelujah
Keep two eyes open
Cause jackals live by the candlelight

Bury your head in the sand
Soon you'll be feeling the fangs
So sleep with two eyes open
Cause jackals live by the candlelight


The weight of the world is resting on thin ice.
When the surface breaks, will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect,
What a waste of time I was in retrospect.

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve.
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve.

I'm always gone with the wind.
Crawling in and out of my mind.
God knows I lost all my faith.

A sickness with no remedy;
Except the ones inside of me. (Inside of me)
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me!

Annihilate me!

Do you remember when you said to me: "My friend, hope is a prison"?
Hope is a prison, blergh!

Of all the patterns that I could create, 
I built a labyrinth with no escape,
To keep my 'self' under lock and key;
I am my own worst enemy!

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve.
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve.

I'm always gone with the wind.
Crawling in and out of my mind.
God knows I lost all my faith.

A sickness with no remedy;
Except the ones inside of me.
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me...

A sickness with no remedy;
Except the ones inside of me. (Inside of me)
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me!

If I could silence all the doubt in me;
Accept that what is meant to be, is meant to be.
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me!

I remember when you said to me: "My friend, hope is a prison."


An iron fist in a velvet glove
Another vulture posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become
You are the reason we are bitter and then some!
Bitter and then some!

They sing of saviours, we sing of sorrow.
But we're still holding on, for dear life.

You sold us all down the river
I hope you choke on the vows that you failed to deliver
You said you'd change the world, but death still flies east
The blind lead the blind, so we bomb for peace

Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands
You built this empire on salt and sand
Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we've seen this all before

We've given the vampires the keys to the blood bank
They say the more things change, the more they stay the same
Whilst the liars leech, the crooked preach
So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it,
It beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it?
You fucking parasite!

There's no room in here for an honest man, only callous and cold hearts!

Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands.
You built this empire on salt and sand.
Not all is fair in love and war.
History repeats we've seen it all before

Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand.
Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand...

An iron fist in a velvet glove
Another vultue posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become!
You are the reason we are bitter and then some!
Bitter and then some!

They sing of saviours, we sing of sorrow.
But we're still holding on, for dear life.


This is a wake-up call.
No rise without the fall.
Facing the great divide, you can run but you can't hide.

You can run but you can't hide.

I met the Devil and God and couldn't tell them apart.
I thought I found the end but it was only the start.

I've heard it all before.
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
Just let go.
Gravity, hold on to me...

So come and wash us away,
Just thank fuck we don't last forever.
It's now or never.
Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere.
Because it's gone and it's never coming back.

So make no mistake. It's just a matter of time before the wave breaks.
So stand your ground. The Earth will shake.
So twist the knife, 'cause I am finally awake.

Well what are you waiting for?
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
It's all you know
Gravity, hold on to me...

So stand your ground. The Earth will shake.
So twist the knife 'cause I am finally awake.


Burn everything you have
And leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I'll take the mess you made
And I'll make it beautiful
Oh if time only stood still forever

Hold out your hand and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hand and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again
Hold out your hand and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hand and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

This moment that we're in
Is slow and disappointing
Time will never stand still forever
If you take this chance we got
We can make it beautiful
If you'd take my word
I'd be your savior

Hold out your hand and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hand and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again
Hold out your hand and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hand and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

Hold out your hand and lean upon me
Hold out your hand and lean upon me
Hold out your hand and lean upon me
Hold out your hand and lean upon me

Burn everything you have
And leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I took the mess you made
And I made it beautiful
Oh if time only stood still forever, forever


""How can you stand there and look me in the eye? Tell me that you knew it was coming for us I know that you said I was all you ever wanted But you pushed me overboard Into knee deep water And you didn't throw the anchor of hope You pushed me overboard Without concern for what I was feeling inside Heartless intentions Your favorite game to play I knew that I was never good enough to make you smile Still you play these games you ruin me from the inside Tearing me down I can't hide I can't not act torn about this What can I do to make you see? How it affects me so deeply still I'm untouched from your point of view""


Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I wasn't ready for the rapture, we're only passing through
But these words, they mean nothing to me
I know that time will mend this fracture, I've been lost in a maze
And every route I take, leads right back to you

Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones
Now the skies have been blacked out
I've got to find my way
'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I've been searching through the wreckage
But it's like standing in the eye of a storm
When will I finally get the message?
Some things are broken beyond repair
This is my cross to bear
My own meaningless catastrophe
I never had the time to prepare
Because I never knew that all my nightmares could come true

Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones
Now the skies have been blacked out
I've got to find my way
'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I've spent my fair share
In the deepest depths of despair
'Cause I was too lost down there to care
I wasn't braced for the fallout
I wasn't braced for the fallout
I've been searching through the wreckage
But it's like standing in the eye of a storm
When will I finally get the message?
Some things are broken beyond repair

Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones
Now the skies have been blacked out
I've got to find my way
'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought
And I'm fighting with broken bones
